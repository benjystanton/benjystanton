# Creating a digital delivery culture

I’m a big fan of this [digital delivery culture poster](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday/status/657085783250227200), from [Ben Holliday](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday) and his team at [Digital DWP] (https://twitter.com/digitaldwp) (Department for Work and Pensions).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Digital delivery culture &gt; How we need to work to make this happen.

In case you can’t access the tweet, here are the points from the poster:

1. Work in the open
2. Share, not send
3. Right people, same room
4. Less process, more progress
5. Don’t wait for permission
6. Show the thing
7. People, not resources
8. Build strong communities
9. Fail fast and learn

## What these points mean to me

Although I don’t work with Ben or DWP, I really relate to many of the points. They transfer equally well to the challenge of building a successful team at a design agency or even just as a manifesto for a freelance designer.

Here is how I interpret the points (disclaimer, I may be wrong):

### 1. Work in the open

Talk, blog, and share about what you are doing as much as you can. This helps you to get feedback (and criticism) from people you work with.

You may get bosses who [swoop and poops](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swoop+and+poop). Either learn to ignore them, or find a better boss.

### 2. Share, not send

Send people links to things (prototypes, Google docs, InVision projects) so that they can can view, comment on and contribute to your design work.

### 3. Right people, same room

Get a team together that can design the thing. Don’t separate designers and developers. Work alongside people who understand the product or service you are designing. Include them from the start, but don’t be afraid to challenge them.

### 4. Less process, more progress

Plans don’t work. And they can take longer to write and update than doing the actual work. Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.

### 5. Don’t wait for permission

If you ask for permission it’ll either takes ages, or you’ll be told you can’t do it. So just go ahead and do it. It’ll help you to “fail fast and learn”.

### 6. Show the thing

Make your designs feel real as soon as possible. If you are designing a website, then create something with code and start clicking on it. If you are designing for print, then print it out and hold it in your hand.

### 7. People, not resources

Listen to your team and give the space, time and tools to do the job. Trust them.

### 8. Build strong communities

Having a strong community around you makes all these other points easier to achieve.

### 9. Fail fast and learn

This one is a little clichéd I guess.
