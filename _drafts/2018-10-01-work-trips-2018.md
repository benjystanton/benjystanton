In 2018 I went on 13 work trips.

I travelled to 7 different locations across England, Scotland and Wales.

I visited London 5 times. Most of my trips to London were to visit Government Digital Service (GDS).

I travelled most for training and conferences, closely followed by user research.

My busiest months were February, May and September. I made 3 trips in each of these months.

All trips involved train travel. My favourite station for catching connections was Bristol Parkway.
