## [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

Google Drive is an essential part of my design workflow. I store lots of my files in it. It lets me write, share and collaborate on written documents. And I can create slides for presenting at show and tells.

It's still so far ahead of corporate alternatives (I'm looking at you Office 365 and Sharepoint) in terms of usability at least.
