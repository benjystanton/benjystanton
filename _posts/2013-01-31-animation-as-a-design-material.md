In an excerpt from her book *The Mobile Frontier*, published on Smashing Magazine, Rachel Hinman talks about how animation and movement is becoming a new mobile design material. (In fact, I think much of her article can be applied to web design as a whole, and not just mobile.)

I love this idea, that animation is a design material (like typography or colour) rather than a piece of content.

Take Pixar for example, they may be the first company you think of when someone mentions animation, but they don&#8217;t make animations, they make films. Or, more broadly speaking, they tell stories. They just happen to do it using animation.

Similarly, on the web, I don&#8217;t want to make animations, I want to make websites. I believe that when used carefully, animation can improve both usability and user experience. As Rachel puts it&#8230;

> The addition of movement to a [web] experience can provide clarity, information about context and, frankly, a dash of joy and fun.

If you&#8217;re interested in animation on the web, I recommend that you read Rachel&#8217;s article [A New Mobile UX Design Material][1].
