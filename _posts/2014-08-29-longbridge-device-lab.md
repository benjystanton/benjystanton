I’m working with [Ballyhoo][1], a web development agency in Birmingham, to design an identity and website for their upcoming [Open Device Lab][2] called [Longbridge Device Lab][3]. I’ll be using this post to document my design process in the open, so expect it to change a lot.

The device lab will be be located in the Technology Park at Longbridge, Birmingham and it’s being sponsored by [St. Modwen][4].

I’ve been inspired to design in the open by [Brad Frost][5] and the [Government Digital Service][6].
