Last Saturday (4th October) I spoke at [BlogConf][1], an event aimed at bloggers of all levels. The speakers were a mix of bloggers, journalists, photographers and even poets.

My talk was an introduction to web design and I really wondered how best to pitch it – should it be practical or just a general overview?

In the end I decided to base the talk around 3 ideas that have helped me to become a better web designer…

  1. Release things early, get **feedback** and improve
  2. Learn as much as you can about **typography**
  3. Get familiar with **code**
