Today marks the day that I’ve finally switched my blog over from WordPress to [Jekyll][1].

<!--more-->

WordPress has served me very well over the years but I wanted something a little simpler.

The main reasons I prefer Jekyll are…

- I can write in MarkDown
- it uses Sass by default
- I can do everything locally first
- it’s easy to sync everything with GitHub
- the templating system is simpler
- …which allows me to design more complex layouts
