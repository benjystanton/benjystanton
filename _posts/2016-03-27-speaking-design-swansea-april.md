I’ve been meaning to speak at [Design Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk/) for a little while now and I've finally got a half-decent idea for a talk. (Design Swansea is a monthly meetup that I organise).

## Talk title

“How to be a user experience designer without losing your soul”.

## Slides

## Talk blurb

Every designer worries about being a slave to the corporate fat cats, but if you focus on helping people with their problems, you can avoid eternal damnation and sleep a little better at night.

## Event information

Thursday 7th April, from 7pm at [TechHub](https://swansea.techhub.com/).

[Matthew Jackson](https://twitter.com/matthewbeta), front end developer at [Bluegg](http://bluegg.co.uk/), is also speaking.
