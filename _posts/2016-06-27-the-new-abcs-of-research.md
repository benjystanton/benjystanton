Working at Swansea University has its benefits. I was invited along to a lecture by [Ben Schneiderman](https://twitter.com/benbendc) recently, one of the authors of [Designing the User Interface](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-User-Interface-Human-Computer-Interaction/dp/0321537351). Here are my rough notes from his talk.

## New Book: The New ABCs of Research

Ben was promoting his new book [The New ABCs of Research](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-new-abcs-of-research-9780198758839?cc=gb&lang=en&).

### New research context

The old model of research needs to be updated, because we are facing new challenges:

1. Immense challenges in the 21st Century (e.g. healthcare)
2. New tools like the web, social media, visual communication
3. Raised ambitions and expectations about what can be accomplished in a short period of time

### Research strategies

Some of the principles and tips from his talk:

- work on real world problems
- work with actual practitioners
- we are witnessing a growing movement in design
- design is as important as science and engineering
- talk to real users and have empathy
- the best way to promote your ideas is to write well
- publish in open, accessible, free ways
- form teams with diverse individuals and organisations
- do something small soon… it’s the path to larger things
- be social and be engaged with the wider community
