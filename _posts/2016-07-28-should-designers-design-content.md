In my experience, graphic designers are often relied upon to write the words used in an interface (also known as microcopy).

Designers are also in a good position to improve longer types of content like blog articles. Remember, this content might have been written by someone who is not experienced at writing for the screens.

For these reasons, I think it’s the responsibility of graphic designers to improve a website’s content (unless you are lucky enough to work with a great content designer).
