I’ve just finished my second week at ONS. You can [read about my first week on the ONS Digital blog](https://blog.ons.digital/2016/10/21/my-first-week/). My second week was spent kicking off a big new project, more about that soon.

## We’re hiring designers and researchers

ONS are currently on the look out for [2 user experience (UX) designers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1512692) and a few [user researchers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1512654). The roles are based in either Newport or Titchfield.

## What do UX designers do?
The role has different meanings to different people. I really like this [list of UX designer skills]({{ site.url }}/blog/user-experience-ux-designer-skills/).

I don’t think you need to be an expert in all of those things. But, if you are good at a few (and have an appreciation for why the rest are important) then I think you’ll make a good UX designer.

## Open days

If you’re interested, but would like to know more, we have 2 open days coming up:

- Newport on Tuesday 1 November from 2pm to 7pm
- Titchfield on Thursday 3 November from 2pm to 7pm

## What’s it like at ONS?

The main thing that convinced me to work at ONS was this: [Product is a team sport, a talk/blog post by Matt Jukes](https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-is-a-team-sport-c50d234745e#.uk86uylv5).

If you want to get an insight into the culture here at ONS, then I recommend that you take 10 minutes to read that.

Apart from the working culture and good pay (£35k) there are some great benefits, like:

- flexible working
- a Civil Service pension
- an on-site nursery at our Newport site
- an on-site gym
- free car-parking
- a training/conference budget

I have 3 young kids and I commute from Swansea to Newport each day (50 miles each way). I don’t think I could do this job if it wasn’t for the (actually) flexible working arrangements and support from my managers.

## Apply
The closing date for applications is Tuesday 15 November 2016. If you have any questions, feel free to [direct message (DM) me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjystanton). My DMs are open.
