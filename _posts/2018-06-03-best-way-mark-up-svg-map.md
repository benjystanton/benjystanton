I'm looking for a good solution for marking up semantic, accessible and responsive SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics). The SVG is a complex diagram, like a chart or a map, that needs to have a title, a subtitle and a source link.

## Example

<div style="max-width:20em">
{% include figure.html %}
</div>

```
{% include figure.html %}
```

## CodePen

I've popped the [html into a Pen](https://codepen.io/benjystanton/pen/yEeVOJ) if you want to have a play.
