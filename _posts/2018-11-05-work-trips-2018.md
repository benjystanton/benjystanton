<p class="lede">Inspired by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/AldaviesAlison">Al</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dasbarrett">Dan</a>, I've been making a note of all my work trips this year. Here’s a run down of the key things I spotted after looking back at my notes…</p>

The page is dynamic, so it'll update when I update the data behind it.

In 2018 I went on {{ site.data.work-trips-2018.size }} work trips.

{% assign cities = site.data.work-trips-2018 | map: 'city' %}

{% assign categories = site.data.work-trips-2018 | map: 'category' %}

I travelled to {{ cities | uniq | size }} different locations – {{ cities | uniq | sort | join: ', ' }}.

I travelled for {{ categories | uniq | sort | join: ', ' }}.
