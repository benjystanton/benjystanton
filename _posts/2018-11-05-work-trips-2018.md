<p class="lede">Inspired by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/AldaviesAlison">Al</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dasbarrett">Dan</a>, I've been making a note of all my work trips this year. Here’s a run down of the key things I spotted after looking back at my notes…</p>

In 2018 I went on {{ site.data.work-trips-2018.size }} work trips.

I travelled to 7 different locations – London, Birmingham, Titchfield, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter and Manchester.

I visited London the most – 5 times. Most of my trips to London were to visit Government Digital Service (GDS).

I travelled mostly for training and conferences, closely followed by user research.

My busiest months were February, May and September. I made 3 trips in each of these months.

All trips involved train travel. My favourite station for catching connections was Bristol Parkway.
