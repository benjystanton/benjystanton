<p class="lede">Sometimes you want a Greggs, sometimes you want a good, independent, artisanal coffee shop.</p>

Here's our [list of good places to get coffee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mXwoRE_Ws280rLevbXKl1bzbDl1cfmVD63OLY-lfwrk/edit?usp=sharing) when we travel for meetings and user research.

It's an editable Google Sheet, so feel free to add your own.
