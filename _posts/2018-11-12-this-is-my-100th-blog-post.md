<p class="lede">This is my 100th blog post.</p>

I've been writing on some version of this blog since at least 2007. I've had 3 kids, 6 jobs and 2 houses since then.

It started out as a Wordpress blog with the Kubrick theme. [I switched to Jekyll 3 years ago]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/goodbye-wordpress/).

I showed early hipster tendencies in 2010 by adding a [colophon]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/2010-colophon/). I used "Starkers" and "320 and Up" to build on back then (remember those?).

Over half of the 100 posts have been this year. I blame [Andy](https://twitter.com/mr_dudders), [Dan](https://twitter.com/dasbarrett) and [Jukesie](https://twitter.com/jukesie) for encouraging this over-sharing.

I'm certain that my tendency to blog and tweet openly lead me to working at ONS. And I've left jobs in the past when I've felt stifled or blocked from blogging.

I feel lucky to work in a place where [I can write openly and honestly about my organisation](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2018/10/18/why-ons-needs-to-hire-service-designers/).

Here's to 100 more.
