<p class="lede">Looks like me and <a href="https://twitter.com/@kieran_forde">Kieran</a> will be speaking at <a href="https://govservicedesign.net/2019/">Service Design in Government 2019</a>.</p>

The conference takes place in Edinburgh in March and we'll be doing a case study on making stats easier to understand.

Here's a bit about the talk from [the conference website](https://govservicedesign.net/2019/sessions/index.php?session=102);

> ## At this session, you will learn how we:
- worked with a multidisciplinary team across our department and the wider organisation
- gathered evidence to convince stakeholders of the need for simpler statistical reports
- presented our work to senior stakeholders and regulatory bodies
- learnt about the needs of end users and internal users
- improved the service by co-designing and pair-writing with teams

Hopefully see you there!
