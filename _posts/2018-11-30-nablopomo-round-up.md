<p class="lede">I did it! <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/category/nablopomo/">30 posts in 30 days</a>!</p>

I spent more time tweaking the patterns and components on the blog, rather than writing actual articles, but I think that's okay.

## Here's a quick highlight reel

- I created a [new image post template]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/category/images/) and [blogged about it]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/creating-the-image-post-layout/)
- Added a [link to my RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml) to the footer
- Made a [list of words that my 2 year old says]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/sids-words/)
- Made a [list of interaction design tools that I use]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/interaction-design-tools/)
- Started adding some indieweb features to the site in the shape of [microformats]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/getting-started-with-indieweb/)
- Blogged from my phone using the [Working Copy app](https://workingcopyapp.com/)
- Created a [progress bar]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/nablopomo-progress/) and [key figures dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/blog-stats/) for my blog
- Next and previous links to the bottom of articles

Thanks to [Jukesie](https://twitter.com/jukesie) for encouraging me to do it. And to Michelle for putting up with me blogging every night.
