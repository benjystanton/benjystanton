<p class="lede">Last week, I turned to Twitter for help. I needed some tips on how to cope with some of the stress I was facing at work. I guessed that the challenges I was facing were pretty common to those faced by service designers.</p>

<blockquote><p>Service designers! How do you cope with the stress of feeling out of control/your depth, when you are constantly trying to breakdown the boundaries between team, departments and organisations?</p>&mdash; Benjy Stanton (@benjystanton) <a href="https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

I got an amazing response, and I recommend you take a [look at the entire thread](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793), but I've tried to condense the tips into this blog post.

## Tips for being a resilient service designer

- Buddy up
- Talk to others outside of work
- Build relationships
- Remember it’s a long game
- Visualise your problems
- Switch off
- Zoom out
- Keep going

## Buddy up
- It’s a team effort
- You will lose the will to live if you're the only one driving change
- Work with someone who is able to support and advocate for what you're doing
- It doesn’t have to be another service designer (someone with similar agile, user-centred, silo busting mindset)
- Share the load of firefighting

<blockquote><p>Find a buddy. Don’t say “yes” to the work if you don’t/won’t have one. You need someone who “gets it” (awful phrase I know), is working in the same context, who you can chew the fat and - yes - vent with</p>&mdash; Sophie Dennis (@sophiedennis) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiedennis/status/1096100855718256640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Talk to others outside of work
- Talk it over with people who aren't involved
- Go to meet-ups like [OneTeamGov](https://www.oneteamgov.uk/)
- Network on social media
- Get a mentor

## Build relationships
- Go in as an explorer, rather then an expert
- Focus on building networks not breaking down silos
- Try to see things from other people's point of view
- Find a balance between organisational goals and user needs
- Learn about the personalities and values of the other stakeholders

<blockquote><p>I’m also big into not thinking about breaking down silos but focusing on building networks of interest. It’s more of a strength based perspective.<br><br>Also remember that change needs time. I’ve learned patience over the last ten years of working in and around gov.</p>&mdash; rufflemuffin (@rufflemuffin) <a href="https://twitter.com/rufflemuffin/status/1096321215814402048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Remember it's a long game
- Change needs time
- Be patient
- Trust the process
- Learn to spot opportunities
- Think strategically about where to plant seeds and where they might grow best
- Remember that others are trying to reach their own goals

## Visualise your problems
- Map out your stakeholders and priorities
- Frame the big challenges by breaking them down into smaller problems and attach rough odds of success
- Knowing how hard a problem is makes it less stressful to fail
- Focus on smaller projects or task you can finish
- Make sure your maps are accessibile to everyone
- Go easy on jargon

<blockquote><p>I like to frame these big challenges by breaking them down into smaller problems with rough odds of success in my head. Knowing how hard a problem is, relative to others, makes it less stressful to fail. Then I say, “I tried my best, but that was always going to be a long shot”</p>&mdash; Harry Vos (@vosageroll) <a href="https://twitter.com/vosageroll/status/1096307866829549568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Switch off
- Don't stare at the wall/screen trying to design solution
- Go for a walk
- Change your environment
- Take a lunch or coffee break
- Listen to music
- Take up surfing or yoga
- This can give you time to arrange your thoughts without realising it

## Zoom out
- Remind yourself of the context and purpose of the service
- Remind yourself of the outcomes you want for the people using the service
- Try not to attach your self-worth to the immediate feedback you get

<blockquote><p>It can be hard at times for sure. Reminding myself of the context and purpose of the service, and the outcomes we want for people as a result of the work. Going for a walk. Zooming out. Talking it over with someone not involved.</p>&mdash; (((Nic Price))) (@nicprice) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicprice/status/1096081140929232897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Keep going
- Trust yourself
- Celebrate all the wins, no matter how small
- Recognise that it's hard
- Recognise that it takes emotional investment and mental strength
- Keep reminding folk of the duty of doing the right thing
