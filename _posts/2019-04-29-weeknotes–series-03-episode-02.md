Week 2 at Swirrl started on Tuesday after the Easter bank holiday weekend and the amazing UK weather.

I made it to the office in Manchester by 11am after a 6am start in Swansea. I'd arranged a few meetings with the some more of the team, including data consultant [Julija](https://medium.swirrl.com/@julijahansen) and fellow designer Guy.

I spent a long time in particular chatting with Guy. It sounds like we have a lot in common – we both like striving for simple, progressively enhanced, accessible designs.

Guy's skills sound more technical than mine, closer to that of front-end developer. He's busy improving the [Publish My Data](http://www.swirrl.com/) pattern library. He's been busy adding [automated visual testing with storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/automated-visual-testing/).

I managed to visit the [Magma book shop](https://magma-shop.com/) one evening. I used to visit the one near Covent Garden a lot when I was in Uni in Ealing. It sells very nice design books, magazines and posters. If you ever want to buy me a present, I would like everything they sell.
