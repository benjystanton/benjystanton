<p class="lede">I’ve recently switched my main current account to [Monzo](https://monzo.com/).</p>

## Beta user

I’ve been a user since March 2016 when the bank was in beta, but even though I’ve enjoyed using the app for short periods, I never really used it for sustainable periods because it wasn’t my main account.

## Overdraft 

One of the last blockers to me switching was the fact that my old overdraft was bigger than the one Monzo would provide. So I decided to bite the bullet and get a separate loan to pay that off (and a few other things – ahem). So I could switch to Monzo without needing an overdraft. 

## Switching 

Once the overdraft issue was sorted, I tried to use the automatic account switch, but that failed. I think it was because my old account was a joint account.

Manually switching was a pain.

It highlighted how easy it can be to update your direct debit details with user-centred companies like [Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk/)

And also how bad it can be. With one company I had to request a paper form to be posted out to me. Then I had to return it. Then they posted out a confirmation to me. Which was wrong, so I had to call them up to fix it.

In the end I did manage to do it all within one month. But I did have to create a Trello Board to manage it all.

## Benefits of switching 

I’m trying to be more sensible with my spending and I think Monzo helps me do that.

I love that I can put money aside for bills into pot, and clearly see available spending money that’s left for the month. 

I also like that, at a glance, I can check whether I’m spending too quickly or that I'll have money left over.

## Conclusion

So far I’m really happy. I was slightly nervous when I heard the bad press about peoples’ accounts being frozen, but ultimately, the way Monzo responded to it put my mind at ease.

It would be nice if all companies I dealt with had the same great service design as companies like Monzo and Bulb.
