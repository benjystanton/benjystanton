<p class="lede">A list of questions to help with user research when designing data things.</p>

I was inspired to write this after reading Andrew Duckworth's excellent post [design for real data](https://grillopress.github.io/2019/12/05/design-for-real-data.html). In the post, they list questions that can help you discover details about the data that you're working with. I think the questions have lots of potential uses, and I plan on trying them out next time we do research with data providers.

So, inspired by that post, here's my list of question aimed at end-users of data. 

I've found that with a bit of tweaking, these questions can work for a range of users. Whether those people need their data as written information, spreadsheets or APIs.

- How do you find the data? Where do you start?
- Which specific bits of the data do you need and why?
- What decisions does the data inform?
- What is your end goal?
- What software do you use to interrogate or manipulate the data?
- What manual tasks do you need to do every time?
- Which file formats are most useful?
- How will you know if the data is updated? What will you do then?
- What will you do next with the data?
- Who will you share the data with? How?
- What other sources of data you use?
