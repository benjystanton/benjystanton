<p class="lede">A list of questions to help inform research objectives when designing data things.</p>

I was inspired to write this after reading Andrew Duckworth's excellent post [design for real data](https://grillopress.github.io/2019/12/05/design-for-real-data.html). In the post, they list questions that can help you discover details about the data that you're working with. So that you can design with a realistic shape of information. I think the questions have lots of potential uses, and I plan on trying them out when we next do user research with data providers.

So here's a list of question aimed at users on the other end of things. Since starting at [Swirrl](https://www.swirrl.com/) I've been working on a list of questions that are aimed at end-users of data. For example, people who need to consume data that's been published by an external provider.

I've found that with a bit of work, these questions can work for a range of users whether people need their data as written information, spreadsheets or APIs.

- How do you find the data? Where do you start?
- Which specific bits of the data do you need and why?
- What decisions does the data inform?
- What is your end goal?
- What software do you use?
- Which file formats are most useful?
- Do you know how often the data changes, or gets updated?
- What will you do with data next?
- Who will you share the date with?
- What other sources of data you use?
