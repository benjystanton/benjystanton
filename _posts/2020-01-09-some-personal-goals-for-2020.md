title: Some personal goals for 2020
categories: personal

<p class="lede">Here are some low key, totally achievable personal things for 2020. I'm ignoring the first few days of January, as they are still part of the Christmas hols.</p>

<aside>Also, this is my 150th blog post, yay me.</aside>


## Money
- Finish paying off my student loan
- Don't take on any short term debt (like credit cards or overdrafts)

## Personal
- Take more steps than in 2019 (more than 7000 steps per day on average)
- Only eat meat 1 day a week (that means I have a 52 meat budget for the year!)
- Weigh less than 13 stone 7 pounds (on average)
- No flights
- Spend at least 1 hour a week playing video games with the kids

## House/Garden
- Get the decking sorted
- Plant 5 trees
- Grow some vegetables (start with the pumpkin seeds from Halloween)
- Plant more wild flowers
- Let the lawn grow at the bottom of the garden (again)
