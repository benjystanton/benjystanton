<p class="lede">Here are some low-key, achievable personal things for 2020. I'm ignoring the first few days of January, as they are still part of the Christmas hols.</p>

Also, this is my 150th blog post!

## Money
- Finish paying off my student loan
- Don't take on any short term debt (like credit cards or overdrafts)

### Update on 13 April 2020
- My student loan direct debit payments stopped until April because I switched banks, so I've been saving the money instead. Might put the money saved up towards another loan instead.
- No credit cards or overdrafts so far

### Update on 8 July 2020
- Nearly saved up enough to pay off my student loan
- Going to put it in a Monzo pot, and let Monzo draw from it every month, so that I have access to the money just in case
- No credit cards or overdrafts so far

## Personal
- Take more steps than in 2019 (more than 7000 steps per day on average)
- Only eat meat 1 day a week (that means I have a 52 meat budget for the year!)
- Weigh less than 13 stone 7 pounds (on average)
- No flights
- Spend at least 1 hour a week playing video games with the kids

### Update on 13 April 2020
- My step count was going well until the Coronavirus lockdown, might just scrap this goal!
- We're eating a lot less meat as a family. Probably close to once a week on average, but I've given up counting.
- Got my weight down to 12 stone 7 pounds, need to lose a little bit more before my BMI is in the ideal zone.
- No flights so far!
- Hard to track this, but put some good time into Luigi's Mansion and Kingdom Hearts.

### Update on 8 July 2020
- Step count is averaging about 5,600 because lockdown
- Weight is averaging under 13 stone, slowly putting on weight because lockdown
- Given up meat most weeks, but still having some on the odd occasion
- No flights so far because lockdown
- Currently playing Super Mario Maker 2

## Home
- ~~Get the decking sorted~~
- Plant 5 trees
- ~~Grow some vegetables~~ (start with the pumpkin seeds from Halloween)
- ~~Plant more wild flowers~~
- ~~Let the lawn grow at the bottom of the garden (again)~~

### Update on 13 April 2020
- Decking is done
- Planted some vegetables and wild flowers
- No-mow patch going well, noticing more wild flowers growing naturally, especially in front garden

### Update on 8 July 2020
- No trees planted, but lots of flowers, small plants and vegetables planted in garden
