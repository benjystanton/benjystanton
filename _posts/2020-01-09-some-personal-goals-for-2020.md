title: Some personal goals for 2020
categories: personal
---

<p class="lede">Here are some low key, totally achievable personal things for 2020. I'm ignoring the first few days of January, as they are still part of the Christmas hols.</p>

<aside>Also, this is my 150th blog post, yay me.</aside>

## Money
- Finish paying off my student loan
- Don't take on any short term debt (like credit cards or overdrafts)

### Update on 13 April 2020
- My student loan direct debit payments stopped until April because I switched banks, so I've been saving the money instead. Might put the money saved up towards another loan instead.
- No credit cards or overdrafts so far

## Personal
- Take more steps than in 2019 (more than 7000 steps per day on average)
- Only eat meat 1 day a week (that means I have a 52 meat budget for the year!)
- Weigh less than 13 stone 7 pounds (on average)
- No flights
- Spend at least 1 hour a week playing video games with the kids

### Update on 13 April 2020
- My step count was going well until the Coronavirus lockdown, might just scrap this goal!
- We're eating a lot less meet as a family. Probably close to once a week on average, but I've given up counting.
- Got my weight down to 12 stone 7 pounds, need to lose a little bit more before my BMI is in the ideal zone.
- No flights so far!
- Hard to track this, but put some good time into Luigi's Mansion and Kingdom Hearts.

## House/Garden
- ~~Get the decking sorted~~
- Plant 5 trees
- ~~Grow some vegetables~~ (start with the pumpkin seeds from Halloween)
- ~~Plant more wild flowers~~
- ~~Let the lawn grow at the bottom of the garden (again)~~

### Update on 13 April 2020
- Decking is done
- Planted some vegetables and wild flowers
- No-mow patch going well, noticing more wild flowers growing naturally, especially in front garden
