<p class="lede">I’m trying to get better informed about racism in the UK, so I asked my Twitter friends for some book recommendations.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Currently reading “Why I’m no longer talking to white people about race” by <a href="https://twitter.com/renireni?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@renireni</a>. What should I read next? I want to educate myself about racism in the UK.</p>&mdash; Benjy Stanton (@benjystanton) <a
