title: Generally, itâ€™s better to avoid opening links in new windows or tabs
categories: ux, accessibility, design

- It's bad for usability, because it takes control away from users (for example, it breaks the back button functionality) and makes interactions unpredictable
- It's bad for accessibility because it can be disorienting for people, especially those who have access needs associated with perceiving visual content (for example people who use screen readers or screen magnifiers)

## Exceptions

- the link provides help
- the link interrupts an ongoing process
- the link leads to a non-html-document like a PDF
- the link leads to a large image which takes time to load

In these exceptions the link text should clearly state what's going to happen, for example: `<a>Link to a thing (opens in a new window or tab)</a>`
