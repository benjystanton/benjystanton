  <dd>I wish dudes (it’s always dudes) would be as protective about #a11y, progressive enhancement (and people in general) as much as they are about their favourite tools. This feeling has been amplified 10X since I pushed https://npm-uninstall-facebook.com out.</dd>

  <dd>These days, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. The tech industry is facing a veritable raft of ethical, moral, and political crises. Automation and industrialization are reshaping our world. And sitting in the middle of all that? You and me.</dd>

  <dd>Just over a year ago I wrote a blog post called “Putting users first is not the answer to everything” — it’s been popular — in fact it’s Doteveryone’s second most read blog post, with over 6,000 reads.</dd>

  <dd>This is super handy. You can use @media` to detect hover support, so then, your hover states won’t get “stuck” on touch/mobile. Big props to @NickColley for sharing this.</dd>

  <dd>I’ve found myself talking about anxiety recently with a few people who didn’t know I suffer with it. There’s no special reason for them not knowing. I stopped trying to hide my anxiety a good few years ago – I just don’t feel compelled to talk about it much.</dd>

  <dd>Semantic HTML helps screenreader users to understand the contents structure and gives it meaning. Ask yourself "What is it?" when writing HTML. Use a logical headline order and structuring elements as header, footer, ul, p … Every content not represented by text is invisbible for screen readers.</dd>

  <dd>People come to the NHS website to get answers to their questions about health, so they need web pages that are easy to understand. The content designers who write our pages know that the words we use affect how well, and how quickly, people understand. And that affects their health.</dd>

  <dd>Remote working can divide opinion. Advocates shout about work-life balance and greater productivity; detractors voice suspicion about duvet days or TV watching on employer time. But what’s it really like to work for a fully remote employer?  We became a virtual agency in August 2018.</dd>

  <dd>“Data lifecycle” seems to turn up everywhere. Sometimes it’s short-hand for saying “everything done to or with data”, sometimes it gets a little diagram drawn out.
