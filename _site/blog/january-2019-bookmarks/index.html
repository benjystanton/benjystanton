  <dt><a href="https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/your-talk-of-the-year-2dac396b926a">Your Talk of the Year?</a></dt>
  <dd>One of the things I noticed last year is how often people who are on the speaking circuit basically give the same talk, over, and over again.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/04/changing-the-name-of-a-service/">Changing the name of a service</a></dt>
  <dd>Hi, I'm Colin and I'm working on improving Healthy Start which assists vulnerable parents and children to get access to milk, fruit, vegetables and infant formula. This blog post is about how and why the team is changing the name of the service.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://cathydutton.co.uk/posts/why-i-stopped-using-sass">Stepping away from Sass</a></dt>
  <dd>I try to rebuild or redesign my website at least once every year, it's a great way to keep up to date with HTML and CSS advances as well as workflows and site generators. I launched the latest version last month moving from Jekyll and Github pages to Eleventy and Netlify.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/52146940904">Interact London 2019</a></dt>
  <dd>Interact London is a leading design conference that explores the roles that digital design, user experience, artificial intelligence, strategy, and everything in between play in today's society.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2019/01/07/progression/">Introducing progression.monzo.com!</a></dt>
  <dd>A progression framework is a tool that maps people's competencies (their skills and knowledge) to compensation (how they're rewarded for them financially).</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://clearleft.com/posts/the-design-sprint-canvas">The Design Sprint Canvas</a></dt>
  <dd>We've been running Design Sprints for a long time at Clearleft and are constantly reminded of their power and ability to tackle challenges and test out hypotheses - essentially fast-tracking processes which traditional may have taken considerably longer.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/communities-of-practice-agile-organisation">Communities of Practice: The Missing Piece of Your Agile Organisation</a></dt>
  <dd>Communities of practice regularly bring together people who share areas of interest or concerns. They are loose structures that support their members and the organisation's development of those areas. They often form around a specific job role but can also centre on a specific area of interest.</dd>

  <dd>I'd heard the term Block Element Modifier (BEM) used by many of the frontend developers I've worked with over the years. It wasn't until I started on my current project that I actually needed to understand what it was or what the benefits of using it might be.</dd>

  <dd>The most significant source of confusion in design research is the difference between research questions and interview questions. This confusion costs time and money and leads to a lot of managers saying that they tried doing research that one time and nothing useful emerged.</dd>

  <dd>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) have been around since 1999, but they have seen a real resurgence in use as design interactions have become more complex and CSS/JavaScript have replaced antiquated animation programs such as Adobe Flash. There are plenty of reasons to use SVGs today including:</dd>

  <dd>We're both passionate about how data can improve how government works, and we want to start a data revolution focusing on service delivery and improving human experience. We believe government is hugely underestimating the need to shift how we create, use and share data.</dd>

  <dd>Tobie Langel and I have launched a new site called a11y.reviews (spoken as Accessibility Reviews). Today if you want to identify if a tool, platform, service, resource, etc. is accessible you have to ask the broader community for its feedback. This does not scale.</dd>

  <dd>During the dotcom boom back in the late 90s, I did a bunch of Photoshop-cut jobs. You know, where a designer throws a PSD file over the wall to an HTML monkey to slice and dice. It was miserable.</dd>

  <dd>In 2011, early in my current role, I discussed with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, the strategy I recommended we adopt for all things digital. The strategy was to be disarmingly simple: to deliver. Often, iteratively and repetitively.</dd>

  <dd>We have different ways to slice and dice what we do, constantly on the lookout for ways to organise and categorise what we do and how we do it. And the caveat on top, of course: that the design process is never linear.</dd>

  <dd>Everyone is angry about CSS again. I'm not even going to try to summarize the arguments. However it always seems to boil down to the fact that CSS is simultaneously too easy to bother with, yet so hard it needs to be wrapped up in a ball of JavaScript in case it scares the horses.</dd>
