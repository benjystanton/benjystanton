<p>There have been a lot of “I’m leaving government posts” recently.</p>

<p>It feels a bit weird because I’ve been trying for years to get in.</p>

<p>I don’t think I ever had a master plan, but looking back there were some interesting moments that lead me here. So here goes…</p>

<h2 id="my-first-design-job">My first design job</h2>

<p>When I first started in design, back in 2004, I remember worrying that being a designer was a soulless profession.</p>

<p>My parents were both in healthcare. And there I was; designing little websites and putting client’s logos on promotional mugs.</p>

<p>I failed to see how I was helping to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>There was something about web design that drew me in though. I started to get excited about the open source movement, and how the web enabled anybody to publish and share content.</p>

<h2 id="public-services-designed-without-designers-gasp">Public services designed without designers (gasp!)</h2>

<p>Fast forward a couple of jobs and I was working at a branding agency. We were conducting stakeholder interviews with a Welsh public sector organisation.</p>

<p>They were showing us their latest software and it was painfully obvious that there were no designers working with their teams.</p>

<p>They just didn’t see design as something that should be integrated into the software development process.</p>

<p>It freaked me out.</p>

<p>These were services that I might need to use one day. I could see that they weren’t following any kind of usability or web standards.</p>

<p>I knew I had the skills to help, but I had no idea how to get involved.</p>

<h2 id="government-digital-service-gds">Government Digital Service (GDS)</h2>

<p>Luckily there were a bunch of people who were figuring it out for me.</p>

<p>GDS was starting to make a real buzz in the web design community and I instantly fell in love with their world of design principles, service standards and laptop stickers.</p>

<p>Something clicked, and I realised that I could be a “web” designer and still do work that matters. I just needed a way for a massive public sector organisation to hire me.</p>

<p>Also, I didn’t want to move out of Swansea. Hmm.</p>

<h2 id="comrade-paul-pod">Comrade Paul Pod</h2>

<p>A while later I was freelancing and I came across a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/paulpod">Paul Pod</a>. He was looking for user experience (UX) people in South Wales to join him at DVLA. We met a couple of times and chatted about the possibility of me working with him. For one reason or another it didn’t really go anywhere.</p>

<p>I think often, the easiest way to get into these types of roles is to be contracted in as part of a big external software agency.</p>

<h2 id="leadin-and-dvla">Leadin and DVLA</h2>

<p>As luck would have it, <a href="http://leadin.fi/">Leadin</a> (a Finnish service design company) were establishing themselves in the UK with Swansea as their base. They’d won a contract with DVLA and hired me to work with their other UX designers.</p>

<p>For about a year I worked at DVLA as a Leadin employee. With the support of Leadin and Paul Pod, I got to grips with working in government on digital service design.</p>

<p>I became hooked on the ways of working that GDS helped introduce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user needs</li>
  <li>designers working in agile teams</li>
  <li>rapid prototyping</li>
  <li>design patterns</li>
  <li>laptop stickers</li>
</ul>

<p>It was addictive. I realised that somehow, I needed to keep working in this way.</p>

<h2 id="matt-jukes-talk-at-design-swansea">Matt Jukes’ talk at Design Swansea</h2>

<p>I’d seen <a href="https://twitter.com/jukesie">Matt Jukes</a> speak at Port80 back in 2014. Little did I know back then that I’d end up working on the new website he’d helped to launch.</p>

<p>In 2016 I asked him to speak at Design Swansea (a meetup that I help organise). He gave his <a href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-is-a-team-sport-c50d234745e#.g3eauj6qu">product is a team sport</a> talk.</p>

<p>He painted a picture of the culture at ONS, especially within the digital publishing department.</p>

<p>He spoke about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the digital publishing department’s principles</li>
  <li>taking time to hire the right people</li>
  <li>posters on walls</li>
  <li>blogging and working in the open</li>
  <li>also, he brought laptop stickers</li>
</ul>

<p>All this stuff rang true for me, and I remember thinking that I really wanted to work there.</p>

<p>A few months later they posted a job, I had to try applying.</p>

<h2 id="joining-ons">Joining ONS</h2>

<p>So, I’ve been at ONS for about 4 months now.</p>

<p>Working with service manager <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders">Andy Dudfield</a> and his team in the digital publishing department.</p>

<p>Why is it so great? It combines the best bits of all my previous jobs and more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I get to work with a talented, engaged team … on stuff that matters</li>
  <li>the work is constantly challenging and the standard is high</li>
  <li>we are encouraged to work in the open and share what we do</li>
  <li>nobody is micromanaged or forced to do overtime</li>
</ul>

<p>… and there are loads of laptop stickers.</p>
