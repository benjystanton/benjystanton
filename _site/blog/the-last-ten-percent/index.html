    <p>At my first design job, we used to talk about the last 10%. This was the time that we’d set aside at the end of a project, to sit down and review the website together.</p>

<p>We’d compare the (almost) finished website against the mock-ups, the navigation diagrams and the content plan. We’d stop <em>making</em> the site and try to <em>experience</em> the site. We solved content issues, white space issues, typography issues, interaction issues. We were designing in the browser, although we didn’t call it that.</p>

<p>Sometimes we’d even be shifting pixels about. Yeah I know pixel perfection is an unrealistic goal, but if every element is 5 pixels out, then the overall effect can be a design that feels <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=7e093c5cf4&amp;id=564702bd96">disjointed and unbalanced</a>.</p>

<p>It would always take longer than 10% of the project budget to get this done. But the effect was usually huge. It turned a site from an average one into a great one.</p>

<p>Part of the downfall of that business was that later on, we tried to cut out this process. We tried to compartmentalise our individual skills. We tried to force a waterfall approach and to become more streamlined. We stopped allowing for the final 10%. This meant that we shipped websites that weren’t finished, even though we had ticked every box in “our process”.</p>

<p>For a long time I held on the the crazy idea that better planning, better skills and more experience would lead to projects that didn’t need this review process.</p>

<p>Whatever you call it — the last 10%, testing, proofing, quality assurance — this is when the real work starts. It’s much more agile and much more realistic. It’s how really good products and services are designed.</p>

<p>Now, the last 10% usually takes up about 90% of the budget.</p>
