    <p>There are plenty of well known people out there that inspire me, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to thank the two guys who gave me my first break.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’d just finished uni and my sister’s boyfriend Tariq was completing his computer science degree. He’d met Anthony on his course and they had decided to form a web design agency. They’d lined up some clients and even worked on a few projects together, but they needed a designer, so after giving me some freelance work (where I was asked to illustrate an astrology board game) they offered me a job.</p>

<p>I learnt so much in those first 3 or 4 years. Including designing with Photoshop, slicing and optimising images, organising content and working with clients. I was even encouraged to try a bit of CSS and HTML. They were pushing table-less design too, before most of our competitors.</p>

<p>At the time I remember being resistant to web design, I thought that print was more interesting, so I pushed to do more branding and brochure work. But eventually I came back round, and now I love the web.</p>

<p>We still keep in touch but they have their own things going on these days, <a href="http://www.discountfiresupplies.co.uk/">Tariq</a> runs a bunch of ecommerce websites and <a href="http://www.ballyhoo.co.uk/">Anthony</a> runs a web development agency in Birmingham.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looking back, I really feel like this was the best introduction to working in the industry. So… thanks guys.</p>
