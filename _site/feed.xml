        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;chatting-to-the-design-team&quot;&gt;Chatting to the design team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I spent some time catching up with the permanent interaction designers working in my area. Even though they’ll be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1083097108352303105&quot;&gt;line-managed by a non-designer&lt;/a&gt; (boo) I’ve been asked to lead them in terms of objectives, progression, training and kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cross-gov-design-train&quot;&gt;Cross-gov design train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we had an away day in Swindon. I got the train up and bumped into some of my “old” design team from the Office for National Statistics publishing team. They were on the way to the cross-government design away day in London. The theme was “designing for people in crisis”. I was sad to be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few others I knew on that train too. In total we counted 13 designers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;off-site-away-day&quot;&gt;Off site away-day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Swindon, it was good to meet some of the team from Titchfield (Office for National Statistics other office near Portsmouth). I got on with the user researchers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that, as I was struggling to find my feet in a new team, my new team was also struggling to find its place in an even bigger team. And that bigger team was based in Titchfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of remote working, but I think that a big organisation, split over 2 locations, using enterprise software really tests a teams’ ability to work flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The away-day could have been run in a more productive, inclusive way. But I definitely see the value of spending time together, and this was the first time we were thrown together. Next time should be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;panic-attack&quot;&gt;Panic attack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following days were hard. A big fat inbox (including invites to 3 different recurring stand-ups) pushed me over the edge and I’m pretty sure I had a panic attack. I think one of the reasons I’m finding this move hard is that I’m used to sounding off on Twitter to let off steam. I don’t feel like I can share much of what’s going on right now, so all my stresses are building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My energy went into firing off passive aggressive emails, which seems to be my speciality at the moment, so apologies if you received one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-on-a-high&quot;&gt;Finishing on a high&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I spent time chatting to familiar faces who have been on the team longer than I have. They confirmed that yes there is way too much to do, that I can’t possibly help fix it all by myself, but yes I was probably right to be worried about some of the problems I was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-focus-on-next-week&quot;&gt;Things to focus on next week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m visiting the Titchfield office on Monday to chat with the comms team about the Census brand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to help the Census website team pull together some user needs, so we can begin validating them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to observe some user research on Thursday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 02 episode 01</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This was my first week back after Christmas and my first week on the Census cross-service team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was weirdly nervous because I didn’t know where I was meant to sit, but it turns out that nearly everyone was moving desk. The whole Survey Data Collection department was being reorganised as it gets ready for the Census test later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resisting-the-move&quot;&gt;Resisting the move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been resistant to moving teams, and one of the reasons is because the job feels so different (new room, new team, new products, new manager) and it didn’t really come with any of the usually exciting aspects associated with a new job. I guess I’m going to have to bake my own welcome-to-the-team cake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-something&quot;&gt;Focus on something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus on trying to identify all the channels that a person might experience when using the Census. A simple user journey could include all of these, and more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paper letter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people calling at the door&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a big fat online survey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;email reminders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;call centres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-design-fun&quot;&gt;Service design fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was slowly getting over myself and realising that this is a very interesting and complicated service journey to help design. There are of course many complex behind-the-scenes things that need to happen to keep this running smoothly, not to mention the challenge of processing and using the resulting data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan over the next few days and weeks is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meet the wider team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;understand the different products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;draw up a service blueprint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;map out the stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perform a service walkthrough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identify gaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to really miss my old team in Digital Publishing and the wider data publishing community, but I’m focusing on the positives of working over here*. I get to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help improve a service that will be used by everyone in the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work across several multidisciplinary product teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn about another bit of statistics (how survey data is collected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping the Census, there is real work to be done to help improve the design community here at ONS and I think that being able to hang out with a different team should give me a more rounded view of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*in reality my new desk is about a 1 minute walk away from my old one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Christmas day dinner timings 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;We cooked Christmas dinner this year, for the first time in at least 6 years. On Christmas Eve we planned our timings in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turkey was about 7 kilograms (about 15 pounds) which was too big for 7 people, even allowing for Boxing Day leftovers (10 pound next year?). We used recipes from Nigella and Jamie for the turkey and it turned out well. It had been soaking in a brine bath for almost 2 days. We cooked it for about 4 hours in the end (which was probably a smidge too long).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://public.digital/2018/11/29/adding-value-by-adding-values/&quot;&gt;Adding value, by adding values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This week I had the great honour of being named by the RSA as the first Royal Designer for Industry for Service Design. My hope is to inspire the next generation of designers, just as the current Royal Designers for Industry have inspired me.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/bymds/flowkit-1e195759a2b6&quot;&gt;Design native userflows right inside Figma and Sketch with Flowkit 2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Drawing and editing lots of lines and boxes for user flows in any design tool is is a real pain. If you’ve ever done it, you know what I’m talking about. Even if you manage to get it done for your current project, there’s always the next project that needs almost the same treatment.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/releasing-design-systems-57fca91a23f6&quot;&gt;Releasing Design Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Companies realize a design system’s value when adopting products use a system to make and ship experiences that their customers use. As a part of that value chain, the system releases features over time. This puts the system into the hands of its customer: designers and engineers doing their job.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Heydon/reluctant-gatekeeping-the-problem-with-full-stack-e9ad836570f6&quot;&gt;Reluctant Gatekeeping: The Problem With Full Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Much of my career as a web designer has been spent, quite happily, working alongside programmers, engineers, people with computer science degrees. In this symbiotic relationship, each party has a secure job with a well-defined role, and gets to work on the thing they are best at and enjoy the most.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/14562&quot;&gt;Prototypes and production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;When we do front-end development at Clearleft, we’re usually delivering production code, often in the form of a component library. That means our priorities are performance, accessibility, robustness, and other markers of quality when it comes to web development.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.24a11y.com/2018/accessible-svg-icons-with-inline-sprites/&quot;&gt;Accessible SVG Icons with Inline Sprites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;If we were searching for reasons to use icons on a project, we don’t need to go far in order to find them.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Tap, tap, one, two… is this thing on? Ahem … My dear designer friends, I have a confession to make, on behalf on anyone who’s ever worked in the field of digital accessibility. We, the accessibility community, have been lying to you for the better part of the last twenty years.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;By now, I have to be on record at least a few thousand times in saying that WebPageTest.org is an absurdly valuable tool. Pat gave the performance community an incredible gift by building it and making it available to the broader community for free. I spend a lot of time in WebPageTest.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smallmultiples/sketch-chippencharts&quot;&gt;Sketch plugin for charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is a Sketch plugin for creating charts with random data for use in mockups. Change the size of selected rectangles. Chose between random and linear. Works for both horizontal and vertical bar charts. Made with love by Small Multiples in Chippendale.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/&quot;&gt;About HTML semantics and front-end architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A collection of thoughts, experiences, ideas that I like, and ideas that I have been experimenting with over the last year. It covers HTML semantics, components and approaches to front-end architecture, class naming patterns, and HTTP compression.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Making incremental changes to prototypes isn’t iterative.  When we’re designing prototypes and user journeys to meet user needs we’re not going to get this right first time. We learn more about user needs as a result of designing and testing possible solutions.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/&quot;&gt;The Ecological Impact of Browser Diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Early in my career when I worked at agencies and later at Microsoft on Edge, I heard the same lament over and over: &quot;Argh, why doesn’t Edge just run on Blink? Then I would have access to ALL THE APIs I want to use and would only have to test in one browser!&quot;&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Web performance is critical for user experience. Prioritize it before it becomes a problem.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Mr Downey spurred a bit of conversation on Twitter about the idea of ‘alpha’ stages in the GDS delivery cycle.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;A lot of factors are at play within an organisation that hinders or helps good design to happen. Investing effort into maintaining a strong design culture is important. For a good design culture to thrive certain things need to be in place.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Colours is a big part of what makes up graphics and making colours accessible is important. We’re used to thinking of colours in terms of red, green and blue. Add these colours together and you get white. We can describe colours using RGB, breaking up each colour channel into 256 parts.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;SmugMug, the professional photography oriented company, bought Flickr in April 2018. On November 1, 2018, SmugMug announced changes to its free and paid (or “Pro”) tier. SmugMug said that the 1TB of storage that Yahoo gave free-tier users is not sustainable.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;If you’ve searched for “Bullet Journal” or “BuJo” online, you may have seen the elaborately illustrated interpretations people have created. They’re gorgeous–motivating to some, but intimidating to many others.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;The other day, I heard a story about a leadership retreat where the goal was to agree upon shared values. They held a vote, and lo, there was an even split between all the values. The group could not agree on which ones represented the company. This makes sense. Our values are part of our identity.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.remove.bg&quot;&gt;Remove Background from Image – remove.bg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Whether you are a graphic designer, photographer or selfie lover: Removing backgrounds has never been easier. Spending hour after hour separating foregrounds from backgrounds? There's a better way now - and it's FREE.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;I’ve had the pleasure of working for a variety of clients – both large and small – over the last 25 years. In addition to my work as a design consultant, I’ve worked as an educator, leading the Interaction Design team at Belfast School of Art, for the last 15 years.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;01. Minimal viable bureaucracy — I’m not one of those JFDI people. I believe that is the fastest way to get something done that will not stick. If we are in this to make real change then that isn’t good enough.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;As part of a minor org shuffle this week I will no longer be working directly with Benjy. Benjy isnt a showy man, so wouldn't want a fuss, but he is a brilliant writer and his blog is one we should all keep an eye on.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;It has come to my attention that many in the web standards gang are feeling grumpy about Full Stack Developer™’s lack of deep knowledge about HTML. One well-intentioned article about 10 things to learn for becoming a solid full-stack JavaScript developer said&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tink.uk/understanding-semantics/&quot;&gt;Understanding semantics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The word “semantic” is regularly used in the context of web development. We talk about “semantic code” and the “semantics” of a given element, but what do we really mean by it, and why is it important?  The word semantic comes from the French sémantique, meaning non-comparable.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;They were looking for developers, interaction designers, user researchers, product and delivery managers. There were even spots for a couple of content designers (we’re a depressingly rare breed in design system teams). But there was one glaring omission: they weren’t hiring a service designer.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Our boss, Permanent Secretary Jonathan Slater, posted last week over on the Civil Service Blog about how we’re working to make the Department for Education user-centred. This post sets out a bit more about what we mean by that, and what we’re doing about it.&lt;/dd&gt;

        <title>Five things Andy taught me</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This is my response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;’s blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://mrdudders.posthaven.com/five-things-benjy-taught-me&quot;&gt;five things Benjy taught me&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re tired by our cheesy web bromance, turn away now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy is a great leader. Over the past 2 years, he has gone out of his way to help me do a good job. And he’s used his experience and contacts to help me become a better designer. I honestly would not have survived my first 2 years as a civil servant without his help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 things he helped me to understand…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love the Web&lt;/strong&gt; — Andy loves the Web more than anyone I know. He’s shown me its value as a tool for empowering democracy and debate. And that the mission to publish open data is worth fighting for (because it will save the world).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work in the open&lt;/strong&gt; — to live and breath the web, you have to work in the open too. Blog, tweet, week note, speak at meet-ups. It helps you to formulate your ideas and become a better practitioner. It helps other teams going through the same problem. And it invites external people to advise you on the problems you are facing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support culture&lt;/strong&gt; — you have to work hard at culture. Doing digital work in big organisations that don’t always understand its value is hard. Culture and supportive teams make it possible, but it doesn’t happen by accident. And it doesn’t happen from the top down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust your team&lt;/strong&gt; — Andy trusts his team completely. He hires good people and he gets out of their way. This is what I am trying to do with the designers that I work with. In fact, everything I have learnt about management and leadership I have learnt from Andy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be human&lt;/strong&gt; — Andy has never asked me to be anything but myself. It doesn’t matter to him that I’m introverted, or that I’m a bit scruffy, or that I need to leave early to get home for the kids. Just work hard and be nice to people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy is making great things happen at ONS (Office for National Statistics) and he never takes any of the credit. If you have a chance to work with him, I recommend you take it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A user manual for me</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;I’m joining a new team in Office for National Statistics (ONS), so it seemed like a good time to finally create &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694&quot;&gt;a user manual for me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conditions-i-like-to-work-in&quot;&gt;Conditions I like to work in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I like to work in open, inclusive environments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I like to be embedded into multi-disciplinary agile teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I prefer structured meetings that allow everyone to voice their opinion and vote on the best way forward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I like to be surrounded by good design (posters and journey maps on walls, stickers on laptops)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-timeshours-i-like-to-work&quot;&gt;The times/hours I like to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I live in Swansea and commute to Newport, which means I need to work an early shift in order to avoid the worst of the traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7am to 3pm are the hours I work most days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I work best in the mornings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best-ways-to-communicate-with-me&quot;&gt;The best ways to communicate with me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m happy to use a mix of communication methods (face-to-face, email, Slack, Skype)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll get the best answers from me if I’ve got time to prepare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ways-i-like-to-receive-feedback&quot;&gt;The ways I like to receive feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love demoing my work and presenting at show and tells&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need time to prepare for feedback sessions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I find over-the-shoulder comments difficult to process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-need&quot;&gt;Things I need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To regularly observe user research in person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good digital tools like Trello, Slack and Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to have regular quiet days (no-meeting days and working-from-home days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-struggle-with&quot;&gt;Things I struggle with&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m an introvert, which means too many meetings can drain me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long email threads with lots of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acronyms and jargon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-i-love&quot;&gt;Things I love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles&quot;&gt;Government design principles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User-centred design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government Digital Service (GDS) service standard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogging and sharing my thoughts on Twitter (let me know if anything should be kept private)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things-to-know-about-me&quot;&gt;Other things to know about me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Before ONS I worked at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) on the “Tell DVLA about a medical condition or disability” service as a user experience (UX) designer&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>NaBloPoMo round-up</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;I did it! &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/category/nablopomo/&quot;&gt;30 posts in 30 days&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent more time tweaking the patterns and components on the blog, rather than writing actual articles, but I think that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heres-a-quick-highlight-reel&quot;&gt;Here’s a quick highlight reel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/category/images/&quot;&gt;new image post template&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/creating-the-image-post-layout/&quot;&gt;blogged about it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;link to my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; to the footer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/sids-words/&quot;&gt;list of words that my 2 year old says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/interaction-design-tools/&quot;&gt;list of interaction design tools that I use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started adding some indieweb features to the site in the shape of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/getting-started-with-indieweb/&quot;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogged from my phone using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingcopyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Working Copy app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/nablopomo-progress/&quot;&gt;progress bar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/blog-stats/&quot;&gt;key figures dashboard&lt;/a&gt; for my blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next and previous links to the bottom of articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie&lt;/a&gt; for encouraging me to do it. And to Michelle for putting up with me blogging every night.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nice people saying nice things about the ONS website</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;It was great to see some smart people, that I really respect, recognising the good work that we’re doing in ONS (Office for National Statistics) digital publishing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom’s original screenshot focused on a weirdly specific bit of something we did recently. But, even this small component went through some rigorous usability and A/B testing. It built upon a content pattern that already did a good job of meeting a clear user need (I need to know if I’m looking at the latest stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is, there is lots more of this to come. This is just the tiniest bit of the work we’ve been doing over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;ve congratulated &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mr_dudders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ONS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ONS&lt;/a&gt; for it separately -- and I will never stop. This is one of the biggest single improvements in a websites design ever. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kXB4s75G1G&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/kXB4s75G1G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tom Forth (@thomasforth) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thomasforth/status/1067360583706652672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Quietly (too quietly!) the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ONS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ONS&lt;/a&gt; have been doing some exceptionally good work properly publishing their stats. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Dg7QNQdW8T&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Dg7QNQdW8T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tom Loosemore (@tomskitomski) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomskitomski/status/1067535685559701505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Gotta love &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ONS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ONS&lt;/a&gt; Quietly getting the job done. 👏 👏 👏 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qAGWKbeXar&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qAGWKbeXar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steve Foreshew-Cain (@s_foreshew_cain) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/s_foreshew_cain/status/1067737646229872640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@msjaneaustin/oh-god-help-us-not-another-thing-on-design-tasks-60fb3552ac55&quot;&gt;The hidden cost of design tasks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;It’s a strange thing, being diagnosed with a chronic disease. At first there’s just such relief, that this collection of horribleness has a name, and that its not ‘all in your mind’, or ‘stress’.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.nytimes.com/kickoff-kit-tools-to-help-teams-work-better-together-3ca6a06b4fc2&quot;&gt;Kickoff Kit: Tools to Help Teams Work Better Together&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In order to build products successfully and quickly, your team has to work well together. But so often teams dive into projects without recognizing how each member best operates or what everyone is working towards.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/05/how-we-document-components-and-patterns-in-the-gov-uk-design-system/&quot;&gt;How we document components and patterns in the GOV.UK Design System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We’ve talked before about the GOV.UK Design System and how we’ve worked to make everything it contains accessible, easy to implement and of a high quality. But just as important as the design and code is the documentation that explains how to use it.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bigmedium.com/ideas/design-systems-mastering-design-at-scale-video.html&quot;&gt;Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Here’s a gift for you: years and years of experience building design systems, molded into a gorgeous video series. I teamed up with Brad Frost, Dan Mall and InVision to create Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale, a set of videos to help you plan, build, use, and maintain design systems.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cushionapp.com/journal/improving-readability&quot;&gt;Improving Readability With Bigger Fonts and Higher Contrast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The title of this post should include a “duh”, but hear me out. A few weeks ago, something hit me—our fonts are too small. By accident, I hit cmd+plus in the browser, which bumped our fonts to 110%, and everything felt better.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/&quot;&gt;The Business Case for Digital Accessibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This article examines the rationale for organizations to address accessibility. It includes tangible and intangible benefits, and the risks of not addressing accessibility adequately. It explores how accessibility can:&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-debt/&quot;&gt;UX Debt: How to Identify, Prioritize, and Resolve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Continually prioritizing fast and easy solutions may help us hit release dates in the short term, but over time, repeatedly choosing shortcuts will leave us with mounting experience issues that adversely impact our users.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;As part of CMD (Customise my data) I was given the opportunity to choose which of out two teams I wanted to lead. I chose to focus on the APIs as this was the area I felt my knowledge was weakest.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;When working with product teams, the job of a design leader is to make quick and accurate assessments about the focus and quality of the work being presented back to them. You should be able to answer the following questions.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-land.github.io/&quot;&gt;Digital Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Prototype This is a prototype. Digital Land is a team at the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp;amp; Local Government working to improve land and housing data for the emerging proptech sector.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;This week, I had to spend time in more than one hotel for work-related reasons. Whilst undergoing this trial, I read Sharon’s inspired post about UX anti-patterns in hotels.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;I’ve put together some of the tweets in a Twitter moment, if you’re into that. All the sources are linked from the speakers notes in the footnotes.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.nytimes.com/5-questions-with-giorgia-lupi-23e2ba972fd8&quot;&gt;5 Questions with Giorgia Lupi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;On October 18th, Giorgia Lupi, award-winning information designer, co-author of the book “Dear Data” and founder of Accurat, a data-driven design firm, stopped by the Times office to talk about her work and career.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@paulmsmith/white-label-wall-templates-1cdec749dae6&quot;&gt;White-label agile wall templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In “Agile walls what are they good for?” I wrote about the value of physical “agile walls”. However I often find a barrier to teams using them (and staying engaged with them) is the work needed to create and regularly update them.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;In agile teams, the ‘retrospective’ is an essential – maybe the most essential - meeting we have. At the end of every two week sprint, we get together for an hour to reflect on how the work got done so that we can learn from it.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Some thoughts about having fun at work.  Last week I had a good time speaking at a Glug event in Reading.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/&quot;&gt;Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This page introduces the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) web standard.  Authoring tools are software and services that “authors” (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content (static web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.).&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;A few years ago now I read something by Emer Coleman that really struck a chord with me — this idea of being ’loyal to the network’ rather than to particular employers.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/public-innovators-network/what-if-boldness-were-an-explicit-value-of-the-civil-service-3df6a3d2d008&quot;&gt;What if boldness were an explicit value of the civil service?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot recently about what it takes to get difficult and meaningful things done. Why it’s hard, exhausting and incredibly rewarding to make progress.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/parliament-and-elections/devolution/local-boundaries-in-england-what-is-place/&quot;&gt;Local boundaries in England: What is ‘place’?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In the last few years, a number of think-tanks have addressed the effects of Government policy on ‘place’. Concerns have centred around spatial variations in GDP across the UK, identifying public spending within a given area, and variations in productivity.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://apgrimes.co.uk/2018/11/17/ux-is-negotiation/&quot;&gt;UX is negotiation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;If you were to say that someone was a good UX practitioner, you could mean a great many things. For example, you could be thinking of their ability to run a workshop, an interview or a testing session. You could be thinking of their prototyping, visual or interaction design skills.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;We recently updated our website homepage, and, in addition to changing the content and visual design, we’ve incorporated two major technical changes: adding a new layout for users with wide screens, and using a variable font.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;This is the 3rd and final part of an essay about design and possibilities.&lt;/dd&gt;
