        <title>Weeknotes – series 01 episode 05</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This week included a trip to GDS to discuss service design and graphic design. Plus location page prototypes, pattern audits and moaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was a bank holiday. I needed a day to recover because I went to The Biggest Weekend in Swansea on Sunday. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BjT41n4BVTY/?taken-by=benjystanton&quot;&gt;child 2 getting into the festival spirit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge-meeting&quot;&gt;Challenge meeting!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/bulletin-new-and-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;The very long bulletin page on the right and the new very short page on the left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I had a meeting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lauradee&quot;&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iankent&quot;&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt; to review progress on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjystanton.co.uk/dp-prototype-kit/sprint/25/crime-overview/&quot;&gt;bulletin page redesign&lt;/a&gt;. Andy wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://mrdudders.posthaven.com/week-notes-spring-special&quot;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; that I seemed nervous. I was nervous. It was called a “challenge” meeting. With my boss and my boss’s boss. Who wouldn’t be nervous? Anyway, it went well I think and the feedback was basically “keep going but make you sure consider a few things”. I made lots of notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gds&quot;&gt;GDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I went to GDS (Government Digital Service) in London to chat to some of the service designers and graphic designers. I blogged about my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/how-to-start-a-service-design-community&quot;&gt;chats with Martin&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/kicking-things-off-with-the-graphic-design-team&quot;&gt;chat with Mark&lt;/a&gt; separately so I won’t go into that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-on-the-train&quot;&gt;Prototyping on the train&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the train to Paddington from Swansea I started creating a prototype for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjystanton.co.uk/dp-prototype-kit/sprint/25/geography/local-authorities/bristol/&quot;&gt;find data by location&lt;/a&gt; journey that we’re working on. I think I do some of my best work in ‘Coach A’ (the quiet carriage on the Great Western Railway between Swansea and Paddington).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moaning&quot;&gt;Moaning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I turned up late. I needed a lie in after getting back late from London. Then I had a day of meetings and catch-ups. The biggest one was out monthly managers meeting in Digital Publishing. I really enjoy the retrospective we have in that group. But I think I may have moaned too much about emails, workflow pressures and tools. I got the impression people thought I was moaning too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know sometimes, if something is hard because the work is hard, or whether it’s hard because the work is inefficient. There’s lots of inefficiencies in the civil service, but you’ll wear yourself out complaining about them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had zero meetings on Friday (apart from stand-ups). This is rare so I managed to do lots of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pattern-audit&quot;&gt;Pattern audit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/audit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Annotated print outs of the ONS website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a good hour reviewing a pattern audit that our contract UX (user experience) designer had done. We’re looking at all the new pages and components that I’ve been designing for the ONS website and making sure they are heading in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to introduce visually simpler components and larger typography, as well as more consistency with &lt;a href=&quot;https://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;GOV.UK elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-data-by-location-prototype-2&quot;&gt;‘Find data by location’ prototype 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/location-prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A prototype website page showing Bristol city and a map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spent a few hours working on the ‘Find data by location’ prototype that I started on the train earlier in the week. After demoing it to the team, we decided that we should add in a map, a link to download some mapping data and flesh out the journey to include multiple areas (for example Manchester) and area types (for example regions or local authorities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to populate the pages using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-december-2017-names-and-codes-in-the-united-kingdom&quot;&gt;CSV file&lt;/a&gt; that I downloaded from the ONS Geoportal. Then I installed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that allowed me to automatically generate 100s of area pages filled with realistic content. I am super proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kicking things off with the graphic design team</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;I went up to GDS to talk to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markhurrell&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; about how graphic design works on his team. And we chatted about what first steps I should take with the new graphic design team in ONS Digital Publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/keep-britain-tidy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue man leans down to pick up litter. Large red text says &amp;quot;keep Britain tidy&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-meta&quot;&gt;Image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://visualarts.britishcouncil.org/collection/artists/eckersley-tom-1914/object/keep-britain-tidy-eckersley-1963-m116&quot;&gt;Keep Britain Tidy&lt;/a&gt;, 1963, Tom Eckersley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-your-work-visible&quot;&gt;Make your work visible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share patterns offline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pattern libraries don’t have to be code based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create posters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Especially key things like typographic scale and colours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print out work and stick it on the wall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print black ink on coloured paper to add colour (but keep costs down)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cover the environment in “good design”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphic design and data visualisations might need a more extensive pattern library that is difficult to maintain – that’s okay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe we do need &lt;a href=&quot;http://onsdigital.github.io/ons-pattern-library-starter/colour/#greys&quot;&gt;50 shades of grey&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;british-public-service-design&quot;&gt;British public service design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;British public service design has a strong history of great graphic design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at designers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Eckersley&quot;&gt;Tom Eckersley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ONS is in a position to create some great information and editorial design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zoom-out&quot;&gt;Zoom out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Step back and look at your work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it work at a distance?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it work at a angle?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does it work on smaller screens?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphic design needs to be strong enough that the hierarchy still works under pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How to start a service design community</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Here are my notes from today’s cross-gov service design call. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martin_jordan&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; for inviting me along and letting me ask lots of questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today, we ran the first cross-gov service design peer support call – with folks from DWP, HMCTS, Home Office, NHS, and ONS. Great questions and discussions! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ll do another one in a month from now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EaaLPEfDX2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EaaLPEfDX2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martin Jordan 🌈 (@Martin_Jordan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan/status/1001824939496869888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-start-a-service-design-community&quot;&gt;How to start a service design community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mariecheungsays&quot;&gt;Marie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tsmz&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; at DWP gave some tips on how to grow your own service design community. Warning: this will create demand for service design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extend the invite beyond user-centred design roles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include policy makers, business architects and business analysts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find allies to help&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try an “intro to service design” workshop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start lunch time meet-ups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start user-centred design show and tells (designers, researchers, performance analysts)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow people to join remotely, use quick and easy tools like Google Meet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the word using offline channels too (for example; posters in the kitchen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie has written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/01/building-up-our-service-design-community/&quot;&gt;building up the service design community&lt;/a&gt; in DWP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-to-start-doing-service-design&quot;&gt;Why to start doing service design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanjay talked about how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard&quot;&gt;digital service standard&lt;/a&gt; is changing to become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/03/07/what-we-need-to-do-to-support-end-to-end-services-across-government/&quot;&gt;service standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;service designers help organisations &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/18/what-we-mean-by-service-design/&quot;&gt;design services&lt;/a&gt; that work end-to-end, front to back and across every channel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-do-service-design&quot;&gt;How to do service design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard bit. You need service designers. But it’s not just work for one person. Everyone helps to design services. Try to structure the whole organisation around users. A key theme that keeps coming up when I talk to people about design recently is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;zoom in and zoom out – you need to consider the details and the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to a service design conference (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://serviceexperiencecamp.de/&quot;&gt;Service
Experience
Camp&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a business case to hire service designers (in the open)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the next cross-gov service design meet-up (maybe host it in South Wales)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 01 episode 04</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This week, we got a new graphic designer and a new user experience designer. Ryan Dunn popped in too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lead-graphic-designer-starts&quot;&gt;Lead graphic designer starts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NationJoseph&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;’s first day. Joe’s the lead graphic designer in the digital content team. It’s great to finally complete the graphic design team, hiring them has been my main focus for the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was my usual non-work day, to look after the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contract-user-experience-ux-designer-starts&quot;&gt;Contract user experience (UX) designer starts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new starter this week. We’ve hired a temporary UX designer to help while we hire a permanent replacement. Did I mention we’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1581727&quot;&gt;hiring a UX designer&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-of-sprint-24&quot;&gt;End of sprint 24&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a good day for the new starters as we had our fortnightly show and tell, covering &lt;a href=&quot;https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-prototypes/#sprint-24&quot;&gt;things we’d done to improve the ONS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publish-a-dataset-prototype&quot;&gt;Publish a dataset prototype&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus has been working on the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjystanton.co.uk/dp-prototype-kit/sprint/24/publish-a-dataset/&quot;&gt;publish a dataset&lt;/a&gt;’ prototype. The next step is to test the second iteration with the publishing team, to see if we’ve solved some of the problems we found last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ryan-dunn-pops-in&quot;&gt;Ryan Dunn pops in&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/data-design-community-idea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post its with that say things like GDS, data design principles and user needs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drryandunn&quot;&gt;Ryan from DWP&lt;/a&gt; visited on Thursday. At lunch time, he demo’d some of the things he’s been working on, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/data-for-people-who-dont-like-data/&quot;&gt;Churchill&lt;/a&gt;. And afterwards we had a chat about starting a cross-gov data design community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton&quot;&gt;Let me know if you’re up for joining that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bulletin-design-workshop&quot;&gt;Bulletin design workshop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/bulletin-workshop-plan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our plan for the bulletin workshop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had an all-day workshop to continue the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2018/05/17/making-better-bulletins-lets-start-with-what-we-know/&quot;&gt;bulletin&lt;/a&gt; work we’d started in the design sprint a few weeks ago. We wanted to get together and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benjystanton.co.uk/dp-prototype-kit/sprint/25/crime-overview/&quot;&gt;iterate on the prototype&lt;/a&gt;, following the first round of user research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to get product manager, UX design, content design, graphic design and editorial back together, working on the prototype at the same time. We also managed to book the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/darrenwaters/status/999683035489554432&quot;&gt;best room in the house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;catch-up-with-joe&quot;&gt;Catch-up with Joe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning I had a quick catch-up with Joe after his first week. I’m excited to work with him and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrandybudd&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; to start taking control of the design workflow and plan out the things we want to achieve now we have a full team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ux-designer-promotions&quot;&gt;UX designer promotions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a meeting to discuss promotion opportunities for the UX designers. The plan is to get UX design signed up to the ‘variable grade’ thing so that we can promote people when they reach the next level in experience and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help us to reward good people, and hang on to them for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Our user research community of practice has been thinking about how we should approach our work. We decided to produce a set of principles that we believe underpin our purpose and our ways of working.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigabbott.co.uk/designing-the-impossible-makes-it-possible&quot;&gt;Designing the impossible makes it possible&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;As an interaction designer, I hear a sentence at least once on every project I work on. &quot;We can't do that because [insert mediocre excuse here].&quot; A lot of the time this is because of technology restrictions. We can't integrate with legacy systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/the-fast-and-slow-of-design&quot;&gt;The Fast and Slow of Design&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Move fast, break things. Fail forward. Fail fast. Always be shipping. These idioms are all around us in the tech industry. Establishing themselves in small, garage-band startups, they are now deeply entrenched in working cultures of even the most traditional publicly listed companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/whats-in-a-pattern-name/&quot;&gt;What's in a pattern name?&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Some time ago, I worked with a large client, helping them to catalog their existing design patterns, and to understand how they could establish a broader design system.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/where-lines-break-is-complicated-heres-all-the-related-css-and-html/&quot;&gt;Where Lines Break is Complicated. Here's all the Related CSS and HTML.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Say you have a really long word within some text inside an element that isn't wide enough to hold it. A common cause of that is a long URL finding it's way into copy. What happens? It depends on the CSS. How that CSS is controlling the layout and what the CSS is telling the text to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;You are in your mid-twenties and your vision is 20/20 or better. You are not color blind and all the devices you own have a retina screen. You are standing in a major city and your internet is fast. Your vision isn't 20/20 anymore, just like 65% of the population, it's worse than that.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Design sprints are snake oil, and I'll tell you why. Their creator, Jake Knapp, (formerly) a designer with Google Ventures, promises fast, tangible results for virtually any problem of any size, in any organization.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;We've been working on an autocomplete/location picker for use across government. I blogged last year about what an autocomplete is and why we are building one. While we were building it, we had our autocomplete/location picker tested for accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Meeting facilitation is a critical leadership skill that's often overlooked. Excellent meeting facilitation means that the attendees know why they're there, they get equal participation time, and your meeting's goal or deliverable is achieved in a timely and productive way.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;This is the final post in our short series on using data for content design at ONS. My first blog looked at why we're taking this approach, and the previous post covered the data we're using and how we're presenting it using dashboards.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/17/10-principles-for-service-patterns/&quot;&gt;10 principles for service patterns&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Design patterns are reusable solutions for common problems. In government at the moment there are a number of interaction and content design patterns that are used by service teams across departments.&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;list-pairs__name&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://lea.verou.me/2018/05/responsive-tables-revisited/&quot;&gt;Responsive tables, revisited&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Many people have explored responsive tables. The usual idea is turning the table into key-value pairs so that cells become rows and there are only 2 columns total, which fit in any screen. However, this means table headers need to now be repeated for every row. The current ways to do that are:&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;The government service standard encourages teams to work in the open as much as possible, echoing item 10 in the government design principles, 'make things open, it makes them better'. This short guide was written to help teams do just that.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Websites that perform badly can frustrate users and drain their data plans and battery life. You can address this by making sure your service frontend is as fast and lightweight as possible. This will also mean your service works well on a range of devices.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/what-charts-do-48ed96f70a74&quot;&gt;What charts do&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;The most important thing about a chart is not its aesthetics, the technology used to create it, the kind of data visualization layout or even the data it represents. The most important thing about a chart is its impact. Impact is what a chart does.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;The natural way to let users configure their Confrere, so it looks more like their own brand, is to let them pick their own brand color. To have buttons, links and so on in the brand color seems like a no-brainer. But it's easier said than done.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Using data to investigate how people use content can challenge our assumptions in surprising ways. We've recently decided to remove Basic rights at work, the most visited advice page on our website.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Last year I made a complete copy of the Service Manual for some user research. One of my teams was planning some research to test some new content for the Service Manual with users.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;As someone who studied Information Science, I’ve always been drawn to grouping and categorizing things. Imagine my glee when I first learned there was a UX research method that was all about grouping and categorizing.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;What questions to ask users? What to consider while prototyping? And what are the best practices in search interface design?  Depending on the project, search may be one of the most complex features.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;Last year, Citizens Advice helped over 2.6 million people directly and our digital advice had 41 million hits.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;I love reading about how other Design teams are working together and what tools they’re using. It’s reassuring to know teams you admire and respect use the same tools you do.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;There has been ongoing discussion, mainly on twitter, about Dragon naturally speaking, ARIA and Accessibility APIs. A recent tweet informs these notes.  #dragon doesn’t support #aria &amp;amp; according to @ewaccess, it probably never will. It’s definitely an AT solution nonetheless. #a11yCampTO&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Service walkthrough</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Service walkthroughs are a service design tool. Observe a service by going through the stages of the user journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-service-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;How to use service walkthroughs…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;facilitator creates and acts out a scenario&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;participant pretends to be a user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;walkthrough each touchpoint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;put equal emphasis on digital and human interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-service-walkthroughs-to-find-out&quot;&gt;Use service walkthroughs to find out…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;key touch points of the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gaps in the end-to-end journey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how users become aware of a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 01 episode 03</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Featuring service design, accessible maths symbols and pizza. If you only read one bit, read the bit on &lt;a href=&quot;#service-design-training&quot;&gt;service design training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-user-research&quot;&gt;Review user research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got together after morning stand-up to review the user research findings from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AldaviesAlison&quot;&gt;Alison&lt;/a&gt;’s recent trips. It’s always a popular slot, but it was good to involve people from the editorial team and graphic design team. (Breaking down silos!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-of-research-and-design&quot;&gt;Future of research and design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead user-centred design people met with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SamHallWales&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; in her new role as Chief Digital Officer to talk about plans for the future of our teams. It was good to see Sam is open to new ideas but also pushing back on us to gather evidence for the changes we want to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stickers&quot;&gt;Stickers!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/coop-sticker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sticker that reads: we design for everyone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; brought back &lt;a href=&quot;http://coop-design-manual.herokuapp.com/principles.html&quot;&gt;co-op design principle&lt;/a&gt; stickers from his conference in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-a-user-experience-designer&quot;&gt;Hiring a user experience designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advert to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1581727&quot;&gt;hire a user experience designer&lt;/a&gt; to replace Tom went live! No-one can replace Tom obviously – but we have to try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-sprint-next-steps&quot;&gt;Design sprint next steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got together to chat about next steps for the bulletin prototype. We’re planning a one day workshop to create iteration 3 of the prototype ready for the next round of usability testing. It should contain more realistic content thanks to the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kieran_forde&quot;&gt;Kieran&lt;/a&gt; and a more flexible “at a glance” section at the top thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RachelPricetag&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-experience-design-lead-catch-up&quot;&gt;User experience design lead catch-up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wiredimage&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; chatted about whether we’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://fractal.build/&quot;&gt;Fractal&lt;/a&gt; for the next iteration of the pattern library or not. Hint: probably will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototypin&quot;&gt;Prototypin’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day doing some prototyping for the “publish a dataset” task that our publishing team will be using. The exercise was useful, but made me realise I had to take a step back and understand user needs and technical processes in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-site-working&quot;&gt;Cross site working&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I had a couple of meetings with the Census team based in Titchfield. We need to figure out how the designers there can work with the team here in Newport and support each other with consistency, accessibility and ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accessible-maths-symbols&quot;&gt;Accessible maths symbols&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a quick meeting with the website publishing team to check if we can add minuses (not hyphens) to website content (we can). Using a minus is supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#maths-content&quot;&gt;GDS content style&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more likely than a hyphen to be read out as “minus” by screen readers. It’s wider so it might be easier to read (hypothesis). The drawback is it’s more difficult to type and will require manual checking. Seems like a lot of effort, but if anyone should be getting maths symbols right it should be us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: we noticed that our equations are inserted as outlined SVG shapes, so they are effectively invisible to assistive technology. I put together a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/benjystanton/pen/KRrWNN&quot;&gt;quick demo&lt;/a&gt; to show how could add accessible text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;g role=&quot;img&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;title&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;title id=&quot;title&quot;&amp;gt;FISML=(r−Rt)SL&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;/g&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just a proof of concept and doesn’t consider how we’d turn this into a functioning tool that could be used by the publishing team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was a loooong day. I got the train in because I needed to get the train straight to London after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-calculators-pattern-library&quot;&gt;Interactive calculators pattern library&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathew_weeks&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; got together in the morning to review progress he’s made mocking up the pattern library for our interactive calculators. This should lead to more consistent, usable and accessible content for our website and I’m really excited by the progress being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-review&quot;&gt;Design review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our regular design review (my fav meeting of the week). &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Carlie_Edge&quot;&gt;Carlie&lt;/a&gt; showed this neat data viz thing that Go Compare have made called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gocompare.com/life-insurance/you-and-planet-earth/&quot;&gt;You and planet earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;front-end-dev-and-user-experience-ux-design-reviews&quot;&gt;Front-end dev and user experience (UX) design reviews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to introduce twice weekly slots for the front-end devs to get together with ux designers to review work-in-progress. This will help us to have more opportunities to chat and also reduce the distraction of ad-hoc meetings that break us out of our workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to the regular demo slots we have after morning stand-up and sprint show and tells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;card-sorting-with-the-publishing-team&quot;&gt;Card sorting with the publishing team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/card-sorting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;index cards randomly arranged on a table, ready to be sorted&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a card-sorting exercise to help us figure out how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help the publishing team find pieces of content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prioritise the elements on the page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;name the pages and sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;london&quot;&gt;London&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/pizza-union.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a pizza with an egg and spinach topping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After work I went straight to Newport station and caught the train to London ready for my training on Friday. Went for a lovely dinner in Pizza Union thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomten2two&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;service-design-training&quot;&gt;Service design training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/service-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;service design is end-to-end, front-to-back and cross-channel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in London for my ‘intro to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/18/what-we-mean-by-service-design/&quot;&gt;service design&lt;/a&gt; training’ at GDS with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/claragt&quot;&gt;Clara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;. It was really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaways were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service design tools are easy to pick-up (like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/997486239451316225&quot;&gt;service walkthroughs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t have to be an expert to start doing it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service design helps you to ask ‘why?’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service design helps us to rephrase problem statements so we’re meeting user needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;design the end-to-end process (and think about what happens before and after the service)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;design the things the user can’t see (not just the front-end touch-points)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;design across channel (digital, face-to-face, phone, letter, email)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service design is great for facilitating discussions  and creating shared understanding with stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;service design can help you make sure you are building the right thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Martin_Jordan/status/997427134258909184&quot;&gt;see me being trained in the art of service design&lt;/a&gt; in this tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 01 episode 02</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/sisters-beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2 girls standing together, looking down at the beach on a sunny day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;It was the super hot bank holiday weekend – so I was down the beach with the family, along with most of the country. Related: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awen_j/status/994220526171312128&quot;&gt;Awen&lt;/a&gt; noticed that Saturday 5th May had the lowest number of sessions on the ONS website since Boxing Day 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday--tuesday&quot;&gt;Monday &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days off. &lt;span role=&quot;img&quot; aria-label=&quot;Smiling face With sunglasses&quot;&gt;😎&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stats-new-zealand&quot;&gt;Stats New Zealand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelpricetag&quot;&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; started the day early by chatting to Blair and Arna from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stats.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;Stats.NZ website&lt;/a&gt;. 8am for us was 6pm for them I think. It was reassuring to hear their research and findings were inline with what we learn from users of the ONS website. They’re also doing some great work to measure and learn how well individual releases are doing, so they can benchmark their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-and-tell&quot;&gt;Show and tell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the show and tell for &lt;a href=&quot;https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-prototypes/#sprint-23&quot;&gt;sprint 23&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone was excited by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robchamberspfc/status/992301199155085312&quot;&gt;observation level endpoints&lt;/a&gt; being added to the API for some reason. More importantly I showed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-design-manual/sprint/23/bulletin/&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; we made during the recent design sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;culture-and-service-design&quot;&gt;Culture and service design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/reinikainen&quot;&gt;Esko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/likeaword&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; popped in to give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mr_dudders/status/993832910435299330&quot;&gt;lunch time talk&lt;/a&gt; about service design and culture. I really liked what Ben said about culture…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“culture is: what is okay here and what is not okay”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… it reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/&quot;&gt;GDS it’s okay to poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;usability-testing&quot;&gt;Usability testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I went to Birmingham with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AldaviesAlison&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt; to observe some user research sessions. We did the first round of usability testing on the new bulletin prototype and I even managed to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-design-manual/sprint/24/bulletin/&quot;&gt;second iteration&lt;/a&gt; whilst I was up there fixing some of the obvious issues (like missing links).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-on-the-train&quot;&gt;Prototyping on the train&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst on the train back I began to split the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benjystanton/dp-prototype-kit&quot;&gt;ONS website prototype kit&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-design-manual&quot;&gt;design manual&lt;/a&gt; repo. It no longer makes sense to keep them together and having them separate should make it easier to update both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiring-a-user-experience-designer&quot;&gt;Hiring a user experience designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1581727&quot;&gt;job ad went live&lt;/a&gt; on Friday to replace &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomten2two&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;. I’m pretty pleased with the job description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As a user experience designer in the Digital Publishing department, you’ll help us to improve the usability, interaction and accessibility of the ONS website and the content management systems that the publishing team use. You’ll help our users to find, understand and use our content. You’ll work with the design community across ONS to create a consistent design system that meets user needs. You’ll love the web and working in the open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-of-research-and-design-at-ons&quot;&gt;Future of research and design at ONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, just a little 3 hour meeting to round the week off. Me and the user-centred design leads at ONS got together to talk about future plans for our teams. More news on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 01 episode 01</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;My first ever weeknotes! Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan Barret&lt;/a&gt; for finally pushing me over the edge and convincing me to start. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9&quot;&gt;intro to weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JennyVass&quot;&gt;Jenny Vas&lt;/a&gt; helped too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was off on Monday to look after the kids. I needed a 3 day weekend to recover from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments/990913328003338241&quot;&gt;Design Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomten2two&quot;&gt;Tom’s&lt;/a&gt; leaving do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I was busy catching up with all the emails I’d ignored last week. The most important was reviewing CVs for contract user experience designers to replace Tom while we hire a permanent replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had to fill out the recruitment template on SharePoint for the permanent replacement. I think SharePoint is terrible and I predict that moaning about it will be a recurring theme in my weeknotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Carlie_Edge&quot;&gt;Carlie&lt;/a&gt; also showed us the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tredegar-house/features/brewhouse-tearooms&quot;&gt;National Trust tea rooms&lt;/a&gt; which are just a 15 minute walk from the office. There is a lovely coartyard too which feels a million miles away from the lovingly named ‘Government Buildings’, where ONS is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started doing 1-to-1s with some of the new designers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrandybudd&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mathew_weeks&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;). They seem to be doing really well and I’m impressed with their progress despite me being too busy to really help them out much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly on Tuesday we had a chat about how to improve the maps we publish on the ONS website. There were some difficult conversations about how we balance rich interactive content with accessibility and progressive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was meant to be going to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Accessibility Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Neath to observe them auditing the “filter a dataset” part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2018/01/15/customise-my-data-public-beta/&quot;&gt;Customise My Data&lt;/a&gt;. But, I caught a stomach bug off the kids so I couldn’t go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was off again on Thursday to look after the kids, but managed to do some prepping for the contractor interviews during nap time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We (the designers in digital publishing) held a second design review/critique session because I’d missed the usual Thursday slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt has started mocking up design patterns for the interactive content that we publish on the website, so we can begin to formalise the designs and be more consistent across releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/designergrace&quot;&gt;Grace&lt;/a&gt; have started working on the UKSA Annual Report – it’s shaping up nicely after just one week. I showed the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-design-manual/sprint/23/bulletin/&quot;&gt;bulletin&lt;/a&gt; prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit late leaving work, but managed to catch an interview with with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi&quot;&gt;Mona Chalabi&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b0xll3&quot;&gt;Radio 4’s More or Less&lt;/a&gt; programme. It’s worth a listen if you’re interested in Data Journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
