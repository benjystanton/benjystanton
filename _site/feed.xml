&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Some short-but-sweet weeknotes about my first ever week at Swirrl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was my first week at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swirrl.com/&quot;&gt;Swirrl&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve joined them as an interaction designer. They’re based in Manchester, but I’ll be working remotely from home in Swansea (most of the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was convinced to join Swirrl thanks to their digital-first hiring campaign (read: two really well written blog posts about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.swirrl.com/swirrl-is-hiring-ed456c08b78b&quot;&gt;who they were looking for&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.swirrl.com/whats-it-like-working-at-swirrl-b9972a703778&quot;&gt;what it’s like to work for them&lt;/a&gt;). I also identify with their mission of publishing open, linked data to help public sector organisations provide better services and make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Monday I travelled up to Manchester for a few days to meet the team and start to learn about what they do and how they do it. I spent time chatting to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billroberts&quot;&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RicRoberts&quot;&gt;Ric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/northernjamie&quot;&gt;Jamie&lt;/a&gt; and others. Their office is located in a very nice co-working space called WeWork (in St Peter’s Square).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoyed wandering around Manchester, highlights include &lt;a href=&quot;https://vrevmcr.co.uk/&quot;&gt;V-Rev&lt;/a&gt; a really good vegan junk food place in Manchester’s Northern Quarter. When I get some time I’ll head back there to check out some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manchestersfinest.com/manchester/northern-quarter/magma/&quot;&gt;stationery shops&lt;/a&gt; I spotted nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helpfully, Swirrl use all the same admin and communication tools that I’m used to including Google Docs, Slack, FreeAgent and Github. I think this is stuff is really important, especially if you have a distributed team that are based in different locations (and timezones). I’m looking forward to seeing what else they do to help remote teams work together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve noticed is that a lot of conversations happen in Slack, even small updates like “going for lunch” are announced there. This helps everyone to stay up to date and feel included. I’ll have to practice this habit to make sure I don’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for work stuff, I got introductions to some of the core concepts of Swirrl’s work, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data&quot;&gt;Linked Data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework&quot;&gt;RDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a pattern library that is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatbsy&lt;/a&gt; so I had a play around with that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/&quot;&gt;Gatsby’s tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is well written for someone like me who is not fully confident with using things like command line interfaces. I think the plan is to integrate it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://storybook.js.org/&quot;&gt;Storybook&lt;/a&gt; too, so will aim to play around with that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my role is set to include a mix of hands-on interaction design work, as well as working with clients to help them discover user needs and visualise user journeys. A familier problem I’m hearing is that the interfaces required to use data are often very complex and probably expect users to be more data and digitally literate than they really are. Looking forward to getting stuck in and sounds like my first project will be working with Defra (Department for Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs) via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnvAgency&quot;&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sanjaypoyzer/the-problem-with-the-service-lifecycle-5efe278f5119&quot;&gt;The problem with the service lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;One of the things that GDS is most well known for is the coining of the Agile delivery phases. But this image of services coming out of nowhere is just not true to life. Government services are very rarely completely new.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Over the past year, data journalists on the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team have fundamentally changed how they produce graphics for publication on the BBC News website.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Last fall, Katel LeDu and I asked more than 200 people about their experiences with professional visibility in the tech and design communities—including what was hard about it.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://andy-bell.design/notes/125/&quot;&gt;Dudes and tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I wish dudes (it’s always dudes) would be as protective about #a11y, progressive enhancement (and people in general) as much as they are about their favourite tools. This feeling has been amplified 10X since I pushed https://npm-uninstall-facebook.com out.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;These days, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. The tech industry is facing a veritable raft of ethical, moral, and political crises. Automation and industrialization are reshaping our world. And sitting in the middle of all that? You and me.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Just over a year ago I wrote a blog post called “Putting users first is not the answer to everything” — it’s been popular — in fact it’s Doteveryone’s second most read blog post, with over 6,000 reads.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;This presentation on web standards was delivered at the State Of The Browser conference in London in September 2018.   Web standards don’t exist.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://andy-bell.design/links/112/&quot;&gt;CSS hover only where supported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is super handy. You can use @media` to detect hover support, so then, your hover states won’t get “stuck” on touch/mobile. Big props to @NickColley for sharing this.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.24a11y.com/2018/tables-and-beers/&quot;&gt;Tables and Beers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;It’s end of 2018, table markup has been with us since HTML 3.2 circa 1997.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;We have been working with the Crown Commercial Service to develop a new service for schools to find supply teachers and other agency staff. The new commercial deal helps schools get value for money and avoid fees for things like transferring temporary staff into permanent roles.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;I’ve found myself talking about anxiety recently with a few people who didn’t know I suffer with it. There’s no special reason for them not knowing. I stopped trying to hide my anxiety a good few years ago – I just don’t feel compelled to talk about it much.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Semantic HTML helps screenreader users to understand the contents structure and gives it meaning. Ask yourself &quot;What is it?&quot; when writing HTML. Use a logical headline order and structuring elements as header, footer, ul, p … Every content not represented by text is invisbible for screen readers.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2019/pee-and-poo-and-the-language-of-health&quot;&gt;Pee and poo and the language of health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;People come to the NHS website to get answers to their questions about health, so they need web pages that are easy to understand. The content designers who write our pages know that the words we use affect how well, and how quickly, people understand. And that affects their health.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.creative-bridge.com/blog/remote-working-our-story-so-far/&quot;&gt;Remote working – our story so far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Remote working can divide opinion. Advocates shout about work-life balance and greater productivity; detractors voice suspicion about duvet days or TV watching on employer time. But what’s it really like to work for a fully remote employer?  We became a virtual agency in August 2018.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;During the last 18 months, working on my Web site became a daunting task—be that for developing, redesigning it, writing a blog post, or making updates to my speaking and workshop pages. My then static site generator, Jekyll, is why. And a change has long been overdue...&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Kip Williams, professor of psychology sciences at Purdue University, conducted a fascinating experiment called “cyberball.” In his experiment, a test subject and two other participants played a computer game of catch.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our editors’ picks twice a month. Tables are a design pattern for displaying large amounts of data in rows and columns, and have not yet seemed to fall out of favor, so let’s take a look at how we can create tables on the web in 2019.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/&quot;&gt;Make it Boring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A good case can be made for why boring can be preferable to exciting. Read about the subprime mortgage crisis sometime, and you'll see that things got hairy because someone, somewhere, thought that investing in mortgage-backed securities should be less boring and more exciting.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Maybe hundreds of thousands of people are using whiteboards everyday to communicate, create and innovate. It has been too long that whiteboard markers stayed overlooked and the time has come to shed some light on these humble pawns of strategic office play.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;In 2017, the Accessibility Team at the Government Digital Service (GDS) created accessibility personas to highlight common barriers faced by people with particular conditions and provide tips on how to design for them.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Firebreaks on GOV.UK are similar to Google’s 20% time or Spotify’s hack week. For 1 week every 3 months, teams disband and everyone is given a chance to have some self-directed time to improve GOV.UK. We’ve had 3 firebreaks now: June, September and December 2017.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://designthinking.ideo.com/&quot;&gt;Design Thinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The myth of leadership is that it has to be top-down. The CEO has all the answers and leads by handing down mandates. But any chief who thinks he or she has all the answers is limiting the scope of the operation.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;So many enterprises present ecosystems far more complex than “one design system, all our products.” More and more, I’ve found discussions across groups and systems leaders challenging.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Alt text is used as an alternative to an image for people who use screen readers. Use alt text where you need to help users understand the visual content. Do not always make the alt text a literal description of the image: think about what point the image is making.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emmaboulton.co.uk/writing/maturing-user-research&quot;&gt;Maturing User Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Last Summer I was asked to write a strategy for a second stage interview for a Head of Research role. I spent around a fortnight putting something together. I was unsuccessful (in fact, the company changed their hiring plan and didn't appoint anyone).&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emilywebber.co.uk/facilitation-feedback-tool/&quot;&gt;Facilitation feedback tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Many of us facilitate workshops or agile habits regularly and we know if a workshop has gone well if the outcomes are useful. There are also lots of elements of facilitation that we don’t often get feedback on. So here is a tool I use to help think about and frame facilitation feedback.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;We introduced the GOV.UK Design System with a clear goal in mind. To reduce duplication of effort and inconsistency by providing one place for teams to find the things they need to design government services. It’s been 6 months since the GOV.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Note: I transcribed this post from a coaching/training session. Hopefully the conversational style works OK, and it isn’t too choppy. Also, I am very sleep deprived due to the new baby! Which means I’m terrible at proofreading. But in the spirit of continuous delivery … :)&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Last week, I attended a workshop run by GDS Academy that set out to help people working in Policy and Service Design to better understand each other. It was the second of two (the first one provided insight and empathy into what it was like working in Policy, it was excellent).&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/carlhembrough/programming-used-to-be-fun&quot;&gt;When programming was no longer fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I loved programming. I loved being able to create something out of nothing. Solving the puzzle of the program and seeing it come to life. Constantly learning new things while hours flew by, and better yet I was paid for it.  Somewhere along the line it stopped being fun.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@BeckStrickland/the-fiction-of-the-data-lifecycle-90289e15f7b9&quot;&gt;The Fiction of the Data Lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;“Data lifecycle” seems to turn up everywhere. Sometimes it’s short-hand for saying “everything done to or with data”, sometimes it gets a little diagram drawn out. And it’s mainly the little diagram that I take issue with, so that is what I shall be being opinionated about to you today.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianroselli.com/2019/02/uncanny-a11y.html&quot;&gt;Uncanny A11y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The pun in the title is that some people pronounce the a11y numeronym as “alley”. That makes the full title sound like uncanny valley, the concept of human-looking things seeming almost, but not quite, human and therefore creepy. In accessibility, the same thing can happen.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;I’m no color expert. Far from, actually. Throughout my career, I’ve depended on visual designers better than myself to produce an engaging palette and apply it harmoniously across a UI.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;I’ll share two stories. I was speaking at a conference and after my talk I was approached by someone who said, “I had to think for a while, but weren’t you the one who wrote that Medium post about avoiding the word ‘just’?” Now, I’ve never written anything on Medium.&lt;/dd&gt;

        <title>How to be a more resilient service designer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I turned to Twitter for help. I needed some tips on how to cope with some of the stress I was facing at work. I guessed that the challenges I was facing were pretty common to those faced by service designers. I got an amazing response, and I recommend you take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793&quot;&gt;look at the entire thread&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve tried to condense the tips into this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Service designers! How do you cope with the stress of feeling out of control/your depth, when you are constantly trying to breakdown the boundaries between team, departments and organisations?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Benjy Stanton (@benjystanton) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buddy-up&quot;&gt;Buddy up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a team effort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will lose the will to live if you’re the only one driving change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with someone who is able to support and advocate for what you’re doing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It doesn’t have to be another service designer (someone with similar agile, user-centred, silo busting mindset)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share the load of firefighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Find a buddy. Don’t say “yes” to the work if you don’t/won’t have one. You need someone who “gets it” (awful phrase I know), is working in the same context, who you can chew the fat and - yes - vent with&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sophie Dennis (@sophiedennis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiedennis/status/1096100855718256640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talk-to-others-outside-of-work&quot;&gt;Talk to others outside of work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk it over with people who aren’t involved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to meet-ups like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oneteamgov.uk/&quot;&gt;OneTeamGov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network on social media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a mentor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-relationships&quot;&gt;Build relationships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go in as an explorer, rather then an expert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on building networks not breaking down silos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to see things from other people’s point of view&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a balance between organisational goals and user needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn about the personalities and values of the other stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m also big into not thinking about breaking down silos but focusing on building networks of interest. It’s more of a strength based perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember that change needs time. I’ve learned patience over the last ten years of working in and around gov.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; rufflemuffin (@rufflemuffin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rufflemuffin/status/1096321215814402048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;remember-its-a-long-game&quot;&gt;Remember it’s a long game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change needs time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be patient&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust the process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to spot opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think strategically about where to plant seeds and where they might grow best&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember that others are trying to reach their own goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualise-your-problems&quot;&gt;Visualise your problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map out your stakeholders and priorities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frame the big challenges by breaking them down into smaller problems and attach rough odds of success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowing how hard a problem is makes it less stressful to fail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on smaller projects or task you can finish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure your maps are accessibile to everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go easy on jargon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I like to frame these big challenges by breaking them down into smaller problems with rough odds of success in my head. Knowing how hard a problem is, relative to others, makes it less stressful to fail. Then I say, “I tried my best, but that was always going to be a long shot”&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Harry Vos (@vosageroll) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vosageroll/status/1096307866829549568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 15, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;switch-off&quot;&gt;Switch off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t stare at the wall/screen trying to design solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go for a walk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change your environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a lunch or coffee break&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to music&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take up surfing or yoga&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This can give you time to arrange your thoughts without realising it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zoom-out&quot;&gt;Zoom out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of the context and purpose of the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of the outcomes you want for the people using the service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try not to attach your self-worth to the immediate feedback you get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It can be hard at times for sure. Reminding myself of the context and purpose of the service, and the outcomes we want for people as a result of the work. Going for a walk. Zooming out. Talking it over with someone not involved.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; (((Nic Price))) (@nicprice) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicprice/status/1096081140929232897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-going&quot;&gt;Keep going&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Celebrate all the wins, no matter how small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognise that it’s hard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recognise that it takes emotional investment and mental strength&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep reminding folk of the duty of doing the right thing&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 02 episode 06</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Short weeknotes feat. prototyping, Service Design in Government, my strong tweet game and Andy Bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping-in-code&quot;&gt;Prototyping in code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got stuck into my new team’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ONSdigital/pattern-library-v2&quot;&gt;pattern library&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onsdigital/sdc-prototypes&quot;&gt;prototyping kit&lt;/a&gt; this week. I put my headphones on and listened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0002d0g&quot;&gt;Joe Cornish’s playlist&lt;/a&gt; on 6 music. It felt good to play around with code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-design-in-government&quot;&gt;Service Design in Government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made some good progress with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://govservicedesign.net/2019/sessions/index.php?session=102&quot;&gt;slides for Service Design in Government&lt;/a&gt;. I should have them finished up next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strong-twitter-game&quot;&gt;Strong Twitter game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did great at Twitter this week too. My twittering about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793&quot;&gt;struggling with resilience when doing service design&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1095360463192367104&quot;&gt;new data sticker&lt;/a&gt; went down pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Service designers! How do you cope with the stress of feeling out of control/your depth, when you are constantly trying to breakdown the boundaries between team, departments and organisations?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Benjy Stanton (@benjystanton) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1096064210566561793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also became the 100th person to contribute to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andybelldesign&quot;&gt;Andy Bell&lt;/a&gt;’s awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://personalsit.es/&quot;&gt;Personal sites&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;lauras-leaving-do&quot;&gt;Laura’s leaving do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing these notes on my phone, on the train from Swansea to Cardiff. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/LauraFHarding&quot;&gt;Laura’s&lt;/a&gt; leaving do, so a few of us are heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/bars/cardiff/&quot;&gt;Tiny Rebel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;another-check-in-with-andy&quot;&gt;Another check-in with Andy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m no longer working for him, me and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/mr_dudders&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; are continuing our one-to-ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I needed an extra one! As always, I’m thankful for his support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;website&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re making a website for a thing in work and it’s finally making progress, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/leahvardon&quot;&gt;Leah’s&lt;/a&gt; hard work. She has that great ability to pin people down and get them to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often in the civil service these kind of decisions can take weeks to make, so having people like Leah on your team is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-plans-for-service-design-in-government&quot;&gt;Making plans for Service Design in Government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://govservicedesign.net/2019/sessions/index.php?session=102&quot;&gt;speaking at service design in government&lt;/a&gt; next month with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/kieran_forde&quot;&gt;Kieran&lt;/a&gt;. We’re making headway with our talk outline and slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally sorted my flight and hotel arrangements too. Although thanks to the quirks of our self service portal I’m still not 100% sure if my conference ticket is paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self: completing the form that’s called “pay for a conference” does not by itself mean your conference will be paid for. Even if you have all the necessary approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snarky-ness aside, ONS really has a generous and supportive attitude to training and conference attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-plans-to-shadow-a-field-officer&quot;&gt;Making plans to shadow a field officer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a recommendation from &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/drtommac&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, I’m trying to organise a day when I can shadow a field officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the staff that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; employ to go door-to-door and help people to fill in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m expecting that observing this activity will be an amazing way to do user research and learn about our end-users and the needs of ONS staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgot-to-mention-my-stand-up-desk&quot;&gt;Forgot to mention my stand-up desk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I forgot to mention my stand-up desk in last week’s weeknotes. I’ve been using it for about 8 days so far and I’m really enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t find it too tiring. And I feel more likely to walk around and chat to people rather than email or Slack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume it’s better for my health too, but I’m certainly not noticing any adverse effects so far.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/your-talk-of-the-year-2dac396b926a&quot;&gt;Your Talk of the Year?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;One of the things I noticed last year is how often people who are on the speaking circuit basically give the same talk, over, and over again.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/04/changing-the-name-of-a-service/&quot;&gt;Changing the name of a service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Hi, I'm Colin and I'm working on improving Healthy Start which assists vulnerable parents and children to get access to milk, fruit, vegetables and infant formula. This blog post is about how and why the team is changing the name of the service.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cathydutton.co.uk/posts/why-i-stopped-using-sass&quot;&gt;Stepping away from Sass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I try to rebuild or redesign my website at least once every year, it's a great way to keep up to date with HTML and CSS advances as well as workflows and site generators. I launched the latest version last month moving from Jekyll and Github pages to Eleventy and Netlify.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/52146940904&quot;&gt;Interact London 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Interact London is a leading design conference that explores the roles that digital design, user experience, artificial intelligence, strategy, and everything in between play in today's society.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://monzo.com/blog/2019/01/07/progression/&quot;&gt;Introducing progression.monzo.com!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A progression framework is a tool that maps people's competencies (their skills and knowledge) to compensation (how they're rewarded for them financially).&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clearleft.com/posts/the-design-sprint-canvas&quot;&gt;The Design Sprint Canvas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We've been running Design Sprints for a long time at Clearleft and are constantly reminded of their power and ability to tackle challenges and test out hypotheses - essentially fast-tracking processes which traditional may have taken considerably longer.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/communities-of-practice-agile-organisation&quot;&gt;Communities of Practice: The Missing Piece of Your Agile Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Communities of practice regularly bring together people who share areas of interest or concerns. They are loose structures that support their members and the organisation's development of those areas. They often form around a specific job role but can also centre on a specific area of interest.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/?&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-uk&amp;amp;utm_content=brand-em&amp;amp;utm_term=full%20story&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA99vhBRBnEiwAwpk-uJPjOUJKDVIfm3f0CfVsAhktJYEegcGEQTiqoKCVy5IevfHC8UUabxoCnk8QAvD_BwE&quot;&gt;You don't know what you're missing without session replay.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Replay removes the guesswork from reproducing bugs by providing a detailed console log of JavaScript errors with every session recording. Press play for real-time QA, debugging, and issue tracking to give your developers back their time.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2019/01/11/understanding-services-through-user-needs%e2%80%af/&quot;&gt;Understanding services through user needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Understanding the needs of our users is an integral part of building a service that works for everyone. You may have seen blog posts from the user research team documenting our work towards a better understanding of our users' needs for the UK Parliament website.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@davehouse_80809/bem-for-everyone-else-89ccc8ad66f2&quot;&gt;BEM for everyone else&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I'd heard the term Block Element Modifier (BEM) used by many of the frontend developers I've worked with over the years. It wasn't until I started on my current project that I actually needed to understand what it was or what the benefits of using it might be.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tink.uk/accessible-svg-flowcharts/&quot;&gt;Accessible SVG flowcharts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The accessible SVG line graphs post explains how to use ARIA table semantics to make that form of data visualisation accessible to screen readers. This article uses the same ARIA based approach to make a screen reader accessible SVG flowchart.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/&quot;&gt;VoiceOver and list-style-type: none&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Update: Thanks to @HugoGiraudel and @gumnos for pointing out that I can use zero-width space would be a cleaner solution. I have updated the code below to reflect this.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Make Time is Jake's new book. It's about creating time and finding focus in daily life. Coming in September 2018.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@collinmathilde/breaking-down-my-job-as-ceo-of-front-8d884cca172a&quot;&gt;What does the CEO of Front do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;At the beginning of Front, my job was to do everything that wasn't engineering: sales, support, product management, hiring, marketing, etc. We were small enough that everyone could literally see my direct contributions and understand what my job was.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mule-design/research-questions-are-not-interview-questions-7f90602eb533&quot;&gt;Research Questions Are Not Interview Questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The most significant source of confusion in design research is the difference between research questions and interview questions. This confusion costs time and money and leads to a lot of managers saying that they tried doing research that one time and nothing useful emerged.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://axesslab.com/title-texts-suck/&quot;&gt;Title Texts Suck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Here below is a link with a title text. Hold your mouse pointer over it for a while and a small text will pop up. That's the title text. It's added with the title-attribute in the link. Title texts only show up on hover, and you can't hover on 99.9% of all touch screens.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;This week, digital HKS is partnering with Public Digital to convene digital services units from around the world. We will talk about what is and, more importantly, what is not working, with their work.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deque.com/blog/creating-accessible-svgs/&quot;&gt;Creating Accessible SVGs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) have been around since 1999, but they have seen a real resurgence in use as design interactions have become more complex and CSS/JavaScript have replaced antiquated animation programs such as Adobe Flash. There are plenty of reasons to use SVGs today including:&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://happo.io/&quot;&gt;Happo is a visual regression testing service for React.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Happo hooks in to your CI environment and takes screenshots of your application in a multitude of browsers and across different viewport sizes. It gives you a summarized report of all the visual differences introduced by a code change/commit.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://danmall.me/articles/starting-a-design-system/&quot;&gt;Starting a Design System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;There are a lot of great articles about design systems, but I'm not sure I've seen much written about how to start one. When SuperFriendly works with clients to create design systems, the first thing we'll do is an audit of the existing digital landscape.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-feature-toggles/aeinmfddnniiloadoappmdnffcbffnjg&quot;&gt;CSS Feature Toggles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A devtools extension to toggle support of selected CSS features for testing progressive enhancement fallbacks. This extension allows developers to disable support of modern CSS features from devtools.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/15/help-us-start-a-data-revolution-for-government/&quot;&gt;Help us start a data revolution for government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We're both passionate about how data can improve how government works, and we want to start a data revolution focusing on service delivery and improving human experience. We believe government is hugely underestimating the need to shift how we create, use and share data.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybrowser.fyi/report/5c3f2fbc8d118e0014b1a7bb&quot;&gt;Information about your browser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Here's some information about your browser which should hopefully help resolve your tech support issue or bug. To get this report to the right person, you've got a couple of options. You can either share the url to this report, or send them to a structured, JSON version of the data here.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learnvanillajs.com/&quot;&gt;Learn Vanilla JS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Vanilla JS is a term for coding with native JavaScript features and browser APIs instead of frameworks and libraries. I help people learn JavaScript. If you have a question about something or need JavaScript help, get in touch.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dd&gt;Something that I am increasingly uncomfortable with is our industry's obsession with job titles.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-more-inclusive&quot;&gt;Making your service more inclusive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;There's usually no alternative to using government services so they have to work for everyone. Making your service inclusive means making sure anyone who needs to can use it as easily as possible.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adrianroselli.com/2019/01/announcing-a11y-reviews.html&quot;&gt;Announcing a11y.reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Tobie Langel and I have launched a new site called a11y.reviews (spoken as Accessibility Reviews). Today if you want to identify if a tool, platform, service, resource, etc. is accessible you have to ask the broader community for its feedback. This does not scale.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mrdudders.posthaven.com/should-we-measure-if-a-digital-service-is-a-good-citizen-of-the-web&quot;&gt;Should we measure if a digital service is a good citizen of the web?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;I don't like being annoyed. It is unhelpful.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/notbinary/an-alpha-alpha-approach-5d62fb68429a&quot;&gt;An alpha alpha approach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Mr Downey spurred a bit of conversation on Twitter about the idea of alpha stages in the GDS delivery cycle.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://handbook.18f.gov/blogging/&quot;&gt;Blogging Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This guide helps 18F employees through the blogging process and assists them in properly framing their post so that it's concise, readable, and achieves its goals. If you have any questions, ask them in #blog or by email to 18f-outreach@gsa.gov.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/a-guide-to-agile-communication/&quot;&gt;A guide to agile communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;As a by-product of being fast, agile communication can and does iterate as it goes along. It should be possible for a writer to draft something, discover it contains errors or needs re-writing, and then re-draft it again - all within a few hours.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@deanvipond/designing-design-51cdb4a04489&quot;&gt;Designing design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;For the last six months, I've been working on developing a design system for the NHS website, and associated digital services. You may think that working on developing is a bit of a pointlessly long phrase, but it's right.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/participant-needs/participant-needs-alpha-design-hypotheses-b235de89f73c&quot;&gt;Participant needs - Alpha design hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This discovery was to help us understand how we might better design our user research.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/designing-for-the-web-ought-to-mean-making-html-and-css/&quot;&gt;Designing for the web ought to mean making HTML and CSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;During the dotcom boom back in the late 90s, I did a bunch of Photoshop-cut jobs. You know, where a designer throws a PSD file over the wall to an HTML monkey to slice and dice. It was miserable.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@slmarsh81/representation-6573850596a4&quot;&gt;Representation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Now that I am Head of User Research and Analysis at GDS, and I have been thinking more about the importance of representation and I what I represent. I also wanted to expand on some of themes I was thinking about in my thoughts on leadership post.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/table-design-patterns-web/&quot;&gt;Table Design Patterns On The Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Tables are a design pattern for displaying large amounts of data in rows and columns, and have not yet seemed to fall out of favor, so let's take a look at how we can create tables on the web in 2019.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2019/01/17/we-are-not-our-users-we-should-not-tell-them-how-to-feel/&quot;&gt;We are not our users: we should not tell them how to feel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;When we create new products and services it's easy to become emotionally invested in them. We're understandably proud of what we're creating and often attach adjectives like simple, quick or exciting to our descriptions of them.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ldodds.com/2019/01/26/talk-tabular-data-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;Talk: Tabular data on the web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;This is a rough transcript of a talk I recently gave at a workshop on Linked Open Statistical Data. You can view the slides from the talk here. I'm sharing my notes for the talk here, with a bit of light editing.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mikebracken.com/blog/the-strategy-is-delivery-again/&quot;&gt;On Strategy: The strategy is delivery. Again.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In 2011, early in my current role, I discussed with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Francis Maude, the strategy I recommended we adopt for all things digital. The strategy was to be disarmingly simple: to deliver. Often, iteratively and repetitively.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@emilytulloh/two-sides-of-service-design-20f47d2a8b16&quot;&gt;Two sides of service design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We have different ways to slice and dice what we do, constantly on the lookout for ways to organise and categorise what we do and how we do it. And the caveat on top, of course: that the design process is never linear.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.practicalservicedesign.com/outcome-based-service-mapping-feec7e1937da&quot;&gt;Outcome-based service mapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;At the Department for Work and Pensions in the UK government, I work with many teams who are currently tasked with replacing internal systems and improving the staff experience.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/29/why-user-researchers-and-service-designers-should-be-best-friends/&quot;&gt;Why user researchers and service designers should be best friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;The Government Digital Service (GDS) has a long history of interaction design and user research working together. But service design is a bit newer to GDS, so we wanted to talk about what service designers do and what works well when we collaborate.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/01/30/html-css-and-our-vanishing-industry-entry-points/&quot;&gt;HTML, CSS and our vanishing industry entry points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Everyone is angry about CSS again. I'm not even going to try to summarize the arguments. However it always seems to boil down to the fact that CSS is simultaneously too easy to bother with, yet so hard it needs to be wrapped up in a ball of JavaScript in case it scares the horses.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/29/researching-how-we-ask-users-about-their-ethnicity/&quot;&gt;Researching how we ask users about their ethnicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Here at the Race Disparity Unit, we produce Ethnicity facts and figures - a service which presents statistics from across government showing the different experiences of people from different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-reading-list-the-world-wide-work/&quot;&gt;A reading list for The World-Wide Work. ethanmarcotte.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;These days, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. The tech industry is facing a veritable raft of ethical, moral, and political crises. Automation and industrialization are reshaping our world. And sitting in the middle of all that? You and me.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@owltastic/new-year-new-website-7065afa64057&quot;&gt;New Year, New Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Every web designer knows how challenging it is to redesign and maintain your own website. The shoemaker's children often go barefoot, as the clich goes.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@AdeAdewunmi/leadership-skills-when-youre-in-the-business-of-disruption-d42a465fbf6a&quot;&gt;Leadership skills when you're in the business of disruption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;A couple of weeks ago Rebecca Kemp and I ran a leadership workshop at the Service Design in Government conference. We had a great time doing it we had an engaged and lively bunch of people and some really good conversations. We've written up the main points from the session.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://garrettdimon.com/2019/openness-and-longevity/&quot;&gt;Openness and Longevity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In our incessant rush to move quickly, everything is ephemeral. Technology moves so quickly that today's strong favorite is outdated in a matter of years. We slurp up notifications and are fascinated by the next thing before we even fully understand the current thing.&lt;/dd&gt;
  
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mxb.at/blog/on-simplicity/&quot;&gt;On Simplicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;In the 1997 movie &quot;Contact&quot;, Jodie Foster discovers an alien signal that contains the construction plans for a spaceship. Trying to assemble it, the engineers are surprised to find that the crew capsule is just an empty metal pod.&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;services-week&quot;&gt;Services week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/01/in-case-you-missed-it-what-happened-during-services-week/&quot;&gt;services week&lt;/a&gt; – a cross-government week of events lead by Government Digital Service (GDS), with many events happening across the country. I watched a couple of them on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in the week &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne&quot;&gt;Lou Downe&lt;/a&gt; did a great talk on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services&quot;&gt;characteristics of a good government service&lt;/a&gt;. This document has become a part of design workflow already and it’s up there with the GDS service standard and design principles for me. I recommend you spend time reading it if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-after-the-design-team&quot;&gt;Looking after the design team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I spent some time thinking about how best to lead and manage designers in Office for National Statistics (ONS). Recently ONS have switched to a model where designers are line-managed from within their teams by delivery managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be some benefits to working this way, but one of the risks comes from being managed by someone who might not be able to measure and recognise good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a document that sets out how we can best balance these responsibilities. I’ve also set up fortnightly checkins with the team and began introducing myself to the designers’ individual line-managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;went-to-my-first-show-and-tell&quot;&gt;Went to my first show and tell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to my first cross-census show and tell. I was the only designer there (that I recognised) so I hope I can encourage more of us to attend and participate in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was encouraging to see everyone contributing towards one thing. I also enjoyed seeing some JSON metadata on the screen as it reminded me of the kind of show and tells we did in my old team (in digital publishing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snow-and-remote-working&quot;&gt;Snow and remote working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was snow around South Wales on Thursday night and Friday morning so I worked from home for a couple of days. I’ve been thinking about remote work a lot recently, I wish it was more common and acceptable to work this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are benefits of working face-to-face, but I still think we should take more advantage of the benefits of remote working. Especially in Wales where people are more spread out and transport networks are pretty rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emmaboulton/status/1090587439838777345&quot;&gt;Emma Boulton has been tweeting&lt;/a&gt; recently about how it would help her to balance the demands of having young children and accepting new work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty obvious that the digital community is not as inclusive as it pretends to be if people like Emma have to turn down otherwise good contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

    We got a chance to walk around Coventry cathedral on Thursday lunch time
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This week I travelled to Newport, Titchfield and Coventry and I realised while writing these that I'd been on 10 different trains!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;logos-letters-and-campaign-websites&quot;&gt;Logos, letters and campaign websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday I got the train down to Titchfield (Office for National Statistics’ other office based near Portsmouth). Much of the communications team are based down there and I had a meeting booked in to chat about the recent updates to the Census brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw the nearly finished logo and heard about some the campaigns they are planning over the next few years. I also learnt a bit more about the letters that will be posted out to ask people to fill the Census in, and the plans for a website that will address people’s needs around getting help filling in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the great work being done, it struck us that we (the ‘digital and technology’ and the ‘communications’ departments) need to work more closely together in order to make sure that end users encounter a seamless service when they use the Census, no matter which team are responsible for the individual bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-value-of-observing-user-research&quot;&gt;The value of observing user research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I travelled up to Coventry (changing at Bristol and Birmingham if you’re wondering) to get ready for observing user research on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the whole day on Thursday I watched people complete the Census by going through a process that roughly followed this timeline…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User becomes aware of the Census via social media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A letter is sent to the household&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The user goes online to complete the Census&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing that jumped out for me is that even people who are happy to complete the Census won’t just immediately open the letter and start filling things out. In reality we have to consider things like this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post arrives in different ways and at different times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People have different systems in place for assessing whether a particular letter is important or not&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A period of time will pass between receiving the letter and opening it – in this time people may seek more information about the Census or they may just forget&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some people will take a photo of the letter so they can fill out the survey on their phone on the bus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some users will plan a time sit with their partner in the study and use a desktop PC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing user research (and in particular usability testing) never fails to be an amazingly useful use of my time. No matter how many times I do it, I always come away with a more rounded idea of the service in my head. And it never fails to re-focus you onto the most important problems and the things real people are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;chatting-to-the-design-team&quot;&gt;Chatting to the design team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I spent some time catching up with the permanent interaction designers working in my area. Even though they’ll be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1083097108352303105&quot;&gt;line-managed by a non-designer&lt;/a&gt; (boo) I’ve been asked to lead them in terms of objectives, progression, training and kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cross-gov-design-train&quot;&gt;Cross-gov design train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we had an away day in Swindon. I got the train up and bumped into some of my “old” design team from the Office for National Statistics publishing team. They were on the way to the cross-government design away day in London. The theme was “designing for people in crisis”. I was sad to be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few others I knew on that train too. In total we counted 13 designers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;off-site-away-day&quot;&gt;Off site away-day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Swindon, it was good to meet some of the team from Titchfield (Office for National Statistics other office near Portsmouth). I got on with the user researchers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that, as I was struggling to find my feet in a new team, my new team was also struggling to find its place in an even bigger team. And that bigger team was based in Titchfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of remote working, but I think that a big organisation, split over 2 locations, using enterprise software really tests a teams’ ability to work flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The away-day could have been run in a more productive, inclusive way. But I definitely see the value of spending time together, and this was the first time we were thrown together. Next time should be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;panic-attack&quot;&gt;Panic attack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following days were hard. A big fat inbox (including invites to 3 different recurring stand-ups) pushed me over the edge and I’m pretty sure I had a panic attack. I think one of the reasons I’m finding this move hard is that I’m used to sounding off on Twitter to let off steam. I don’t feel like I can share much of what’s going on right now, so all my stresses are building up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My energy went into firing off passive aggressive emails, which seems to be my speciality at the moment, so apologies if you received one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finishing-on-a-high&quot;&gt;Finishing on a high&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I spent time chatting to familiar faces who have been on the team longer than I have. They confirmed that yes there is way too much to do, that I can’t possibly help fix it all by myself, but yes I was probably right to be worried about some of the problems I was seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-focus-on-next-week&quot;&gt;Things to focus on next week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m visiting the Titchfield office on Monday to chat with the comms team about the Census brand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to help the Census website team pull together some user needs, so we can begin validating them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to observe some user research on Thursday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Weeknotes – series 02 episode 01</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This was my first week back after Christmas and my first week on the Census cross-service team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was weirdly nervous because I didn’t know where I was meant to sit, but it turns out that nearly everyone was moving desk. The whole Survey Data Collection department was being reorganised as it gets ready for the Census test later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;resisting-the-move&quot;&gt;Resisting the move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been resistant to moving teams, and one of the reasons is because the job feels so different (new room, new team, new products, new manager) and it didn’t really come with any of the usually exciting aspects associated with a new job. I guess I’m going to have to bake my own welcome-to-the-team cake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-something&quot;&gt;Focus on something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to focus on trying to identify all the channels that a person might experience when using the Census. A simple user journey could include all of these, and more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marketing campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paper letter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people calling at the door&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a big fat online survey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;email reminders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;call centres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-design-fun&quot;&gt;Service design fun&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was slowly getting over myself and realising that this is a very interesting and complicated service journey to help design. There are of course many complex behind-the-scenes things that need to happen to keep this running smoothly, not to mention the challenge of processing and using the resulting data effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan over the next few days and weeks is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meet the wider team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;understand the different products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;draw up a service blueprint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;map out the stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;perform a service walkthrough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identify gaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to really miss my old team in Digital Publishing and the wider data publishing community, but I’m focusing on the positives of working over here*. I get to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;help improve a service that will be used by everyone in the country&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work across several multidisciplinary product teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn about another bit of statistics (how survey data is collected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping the Census, there is real work to be done to help improve the design community here at ONS and I think that being able to hang out with a different team should give me a more rounded view of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*in reality my new desk is about a 1 minute walk away from my old one.&lt;/p&gt;
