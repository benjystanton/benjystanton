<p class="lede">My name is Benjy Stanton and I'm one of the lead user experience designers at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). I'm part of the <a href="https://blog.ons.digital/">digital publishing team</a>.</p>

Previously, I was at [Leadin](http://leadin.co.uk/), a service design agency in Swansea.

I care about user needs, content, accessibility and good typography.
