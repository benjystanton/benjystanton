<p class="lede">My name is Benjy Stanton and Iâ€™m one of the lead interaction designers at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

I'm part of [digital publishing](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/). We focus on improving the ONS website, and helping people to use the data that ONS publishes. I manage a team of interaction designers and graphic designers.

Previously, I was at [Leadin](http://leadin.co.uk/), a service design agency in Swansea. I care about user needs, content, accessibility and good typography.
