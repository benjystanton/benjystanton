Pretty Shitty City was a blog that I set up in 2007. I wanted to give a platform for all the creative / alternative stuff happening in and around Swansea, focusing in on music and art. Swansea has a pretty negative image of itself, but there's lots of interesting stuff going on in this town, if you know where to find it.

## Getting to grips with WordPress

WordPress was the perfect tool and I spent many long nights keeping it up to date with articles on upcoming gigs, art exhibitions and degree shows. I got a friend to build me a custom theme, then I cut my teeth on HTML and CSS by tweaking the design.

## Time to monetize

It was a labour of love but when I tried to look at ways to make some money from it, it lost a bit of its magic. After about 18 months I stopped updating it and turned my attention to other things (like becoming a freelancer and getting married).

I'm still hugely proud of the site though, especially because it earned me street cred with all the dudes in bands. :D
