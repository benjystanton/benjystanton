## Summary

I’m an interaction designer with over 14 years experience in design. I’m at my best when working closely with software engineers, user researchers and product owners. I design products and services in agile working environments, driven by evidence-based user needs.

I'm experienced in working with teams of different sizes and setups, including in-house, distributed or remote. I'm always looking to get feedback on my work, via show and tells, design critiques or by presenting to senior stakeholders.

I've worked on services in discovery, alpha, beta and live phases and I’m an advocate for the GDS digital service standard and user-centred design.

## Key skills

- Interaction design
- User experience design
- HTML and CSS
- Rapid prototyping
- Accessibility
- Facilitation (for example Design Sprints)

## Experience

**Office for National Statistics (ONS)**<br>
<span class="text-small">October 2016 to today</span><br>
At ONS I'm the lead interaction designer in the Digital Publishing department. I lead a team of interaction and graphic designers. I'm responsible for the user experience of the ONS website and the tools that the publishing team use to edit content. I work alongside civil servants and external contractors to help users find, understand and use our complex content and data formats. I create prototypes, observe user research and run A/B tests to help us improve the website.

**DVLA (with Leadin)**<br>
<span class="text-small">May 2015 to October 2016</span><br>
Whilst working for Leadin (a Finnish service design agency) I spent my time at DVLA. I worked on the "Tell DVLA about a medical condition or disability" service as a senior UX designer. I convinced the team to adopt the "one question per page approach" and to focus on accessibility. I built prototypes and iterated them based on user research findings. This lead to the service passing its alpha and beta assessments.


**Other experience**<br>
Between 2004 and 2015 I worked in-house at web design agencies and remotely as a freelance designer.

## Education

**University of West London** <br>
<span class="text-small">2001 to 2004</span><br>
Bachelor of Arts 2:1 in Digital Art and Animation


## Hobbies and interests

Outside of work, I’m kept busy by my 3 young kids. I spend the weekends having fun with them – going for walks and watching the new She-Ra reboot on Netflix. When I get 5 minutes, you’ll find me blogging.
