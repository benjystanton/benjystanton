# My name is Benjy and Iâ€™m a UX/UI designer

I have over 10 years experience designing digital things. I work at [Leadin](http://leadin.co.uk/), run my own freelance business and I organise a [design meet-up in Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk/).

I used to play bass and skateboard but I gave those things up because I was rubbish.
