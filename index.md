# My name is Benjy and Iâ€™m a UX/UI designer

I have over 10 years experience designing digital things. I work at [Leadin][1], run my own freelance business and I organise a [design meet-up in Swansea][2]. I used to play bass and skateboard but I gave those things up because I was rubbish.

You might want to [read my blog][3] or find out a little [more about me][4].
