# My name is Benjy and I’m a user experience designer

I'm the lead user experience designer on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) website. Check out the [ONS digital blog](http://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/).

I started a [design meet-up in Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk/). I have 3 kids, and when I’m not working, I like to spend time in The Great Outdoors or listening to music.

You might want to [read my blog](/blog/) or find out a little [more about me](/about/).
