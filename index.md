# My name is Benjy and I’m a user experience (UX) designer

I started of the [digital team at Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://blog.ons.digital/).

I co-organise a [design meet-up in Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk/). I have 3 kids, and when I’m not working, I like to spend time in The Great Outdoors or listening to music.

You might want to [read my blog](/blog/) or find out a little [more about me](/about/).
