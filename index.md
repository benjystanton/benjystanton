# My name is Benjy and I’m a User Experience (UX) designer

I’ve been designing things for over 10 years. Right now, I work at [Leadin][1] and organise a [design meet-up in Swansea][2]. I have 2 kids, with one more on the way. When I’m not working, I like to spend time in The Great Outdoors or listening to music.

You might want to [read my blog][3] or find out a little [more about me][4].
