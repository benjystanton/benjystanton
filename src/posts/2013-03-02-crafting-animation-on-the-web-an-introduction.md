I'm going to be speaking about animation on the web at Port80 in May. In short, I'm hoping to answer the following questions…

  1. What's possible with CSS3 animation and what does all that dirty code mean?
  2. How can I apply classical techniques to give my animation more personality?
  3. What tools and practices can I use to introduce animation early on in the project workflow?
