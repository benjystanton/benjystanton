I&#8217;m going to be speaking about animation on the web at Port80 in May. In short, I&#8217;m hoping to answer the following questions&#8230;

<!--more-->

  1. What&#8217;s possible with CSS3 animation and what does all that dirty code mean?
  2. How can I apply classical techniques to give my animation more personality?
  3. What tools and practices can I use to introduce animation early on in the project workflow?
