Good old Twitterâ€¦ I asked my friends to [recommend screen recording software](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/690206840827834368) (specifically for recording usability tests), and I got a list of great looking apps to try. Silverback was the clear favourite, although the latest version appears to be in private beta.
