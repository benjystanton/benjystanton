My rough and patchy notes from the Cross Government Research meet-up that happened on Tuesday 12 April 2016 at DVLA in Swansea.

### Stop important stories from being forgotten

- create a spreadsheet of user stories
- give each story a star rating
- star rating = how many times this problem was seen
- use this rating to help prioritise backlog
- product owners can really relate to the star rating
- if design fixes don’t meet the user need, this method helps to push issues back to the top of the agenda

<!-- ### Example user story spreadsheet

| ID | Story | Status | Source | Star Rating |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Story number | User story | Fixed or not? | Date & time | ***** | -->

### Make research data traceable

- create one folder per round
- e.g. date - R12 - name of study
- keep all materials in there
- participant naming: R12-P3-name-of-file.jpg
- prune video files (keep key recordings, delete everything else)
- watch out for accidental deletion (especially when using shared folders on Google Drive or Dropbox)

### Sharing and keeping findings

- show and tell what you’ve learnt (this builds up a “corporate memory”)
- show 5 to 10 findings per showcase
- each slide should have: a heading, 3 points and an image
- share the slides around afterwards
- build up a library of slides overtime
- helps you to understand and remember
- create a summary slide at the end of each phase to round-up important findings

### Share at every opportunity

- blog posts
- make a comic
- make posters
- create “big picture” journey maps
- create things that stay after you’ve gone (this is tricky)

### Documenting changes in agile teams

- things get buried in confluence
- create living documents
- Google Drive FTW
- spreadsheets don’t work too well
- try Google presentations (these are visual, malleable, trackable)
- in Google videos, you can link to timestamps
- create a stack of successes as you go
- use them for decision making
- these will help bring new staff up to speed
- it’s a hub, it doesn’t have to include everything
- **everything must be shareable**

### User needs

- user needs should not become too granular
- real user needs are stable (they don’t change much overtime)
- they come from the lived experience of real people
- read [Indy Young’s Mental Models book](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/mental-models/)
