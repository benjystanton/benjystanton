My notes from the brilliant Port80 web design conference, including talks from Gavin Davies, [Digital Accessibility Centre](http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/), Helen Clark and Ash Nolan.

## Louise Howells

### Why so serious? Running a team hack day

- Louise is a Professional Services Manager at Zengenti
- happy working environments are good for staff
- good offices need breakout zones
- Zengenti call their annual hackathon “Lockdown”
- step away from the day job and do something different
- teams created digital and physical products like:
  - a games room in the basement
  - a BBQ area
  - a website that listed design conferences
- helps to foster a community
- staff started up book clubs and pool clubs afterwards
- it encouraged staff to do job swaps and learn about different areas of the business

## Gavin Davies

### Using build tools

- Gavin is an automation engineer/coder at Radify
- software is advancing at a scary pace
- it’s important to understand things conceptually first
- it’s about workflow not particular tools
- improve your workflow
- reduce tedious, manual tasks
- get feedback sooner
- use Grunt or Gulp (it doesn’t matter which) to automate your asset pipeline
- use linters to highlight bad code
- optimise images and minify code
- use gulp-rsync to deploy automatically
- use source maps to debug your Sass
- Yeoman can help get up and running quickly

### The uncertainty principle

- how do we deal with uncertainty?
- why do projects fail?
- it’s hard (impossible) to estimate project time and cost
- cushioning is when you give a client the worst case estimate and double it, this is bad
- telling a client you don’t know how long things will take is not much better
- Enter SCRUM
- 2 week sprints, then show client
- product backlog > sprint planning > sprint backlog > sprint
- behaviour driven development (BDD) is “outside in” development
- stakeholders define features
- features are like user stories
- tools: [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
- write scenarios for features
- scenarios are like examples e.g. show special offers
- these should be in plain English
- then write a step definition
- sprint planning > define steps (flesh out plan) > do the work > show and tell > retrospective

### Designing accessible websites

- accessibility is about not creating barriers right from the design stage
- developers need to use the right mark-up
- follow web standards and WCAG 2.0
- user testing with actual users with disabilities
- tips for better mark-up
	- provide alternative text for visual content
	- consider users who don’t use a mouse
	- use structure and logical hierarchy
	- don’t suppress zoom
	- `display:none` hides it from everyone, so be careful
	- always style up hover, active, focus
	- Use tools to check understanding level of your content
	- html `<track>` element to add text or captions to videos (webVTT)
	- bad error handling is bad
	- don’t rely on placeholder text only in forms inputs
- [www.html5accessibility.com](http://www.html5accessibility.com/)
- Use ARIA roles for sectioning
- How to use iOS Voiceover
	- two finger tap stops speech
	- swipe left and right to go to next item
	- twist hand to choose different elements
	- swipe down with 2 fingers to read on
- `<details>` and `<summary>` in Firefox with [NVDA](http://www.nvaccess.org/) skips over it completely
- avoid cluttered designs
- mobile versions of sites are generally better
- the less content the better
- label properly, be descriptive but concise
- dynamic sites are hard to navigate, if something changes make sure focus changes too

### Designing imaginative grid systems

- web design is boring right now
- [everyfuckingwebsite.com](http://everyfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [bland.ly](http://www.bland.ly/#blandly)
- (too busy listening to make proper notes sorry)
- [Slides for Andy’s talk: Designing imaginative grid systems](https://speakerdeck.com/malarkey/designing-imaginative-grid-systems-port-80-newport)

### Open and inclusive design

- beware stealth stakeholders, these are senior staff who pop up at the end of projects and try to change things
- work in the open
- document everything done on the project (on Tumblr for example)
- speak to customers (end users) to discover user stories
- get honest, impartial feedback (users might lie if staff are running the research sessions)
- speak to staff (at their place of work) especially front line staff
- create a list of priories based on this research
- create [paper prototypes](http://www.clarkcx.com/advice/paper-prototypes-what-are-they-and-why-use-them)
- feedback can be applied beyond the website, so share your research
- risks of working openly?
	- research should uncover problems not solutions
	- working in the open can make some people uncomfortable (it shows the behind the scenes, messy, ugly bits)
- good research means you can justify design decisions
- [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/)
	- build iteratively
	- people’s needs first
	- design with data
	- open by default
	- ensure everyone can participate
- [Growth Driven Design](http://www.growthdrivendesign.com/)
	- launching the website shouldn’t be the end
	- launch a basic site first
	- build the must-haves, and leave the nice-to-haves until later
	- then do continuous improvement
- beware: clients might block access to users if they feel left out of research
- immerse the client in the design team, then both can communicate with the audience

### Developing for the unknown

- Ash is front end dev at Just Eat
- no docs or commenting leads to legacy code straight away
- put the right things in place from the start: structure and workflow
- workflow
	- grunt and gulp can act as self documentation to show new devs what workflows exists
	- grunt or gulp, it doesn’t matter
	- create common workflows: e.g. Sass, linting, minifying
- documentation
	- good commenting
	- style guides
	- “programs should be written for people to read and incidentally for machines to understand”
	- describe what components do and where they’re used
- style guide and component library
	- look for patterns
	- reuse them across website
	- organise CSS
	- start small and extend
	- components only worry about themselves
	- Read [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) by Snook
- Naming schemes: BEM or SUIT
	- be consistent
	- show relationship between class names
	- BEM: Block, elements, modifier
	- [BEM naming scheme](http://trykickoff.com/learn/css.html#namingscheme)
	- [Statix, a reusable snippets tool](http://trykickoff.com/statix/)
	- Static site generators [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Separate your concerns
	- decouple CSS classes from JS
	- hook JS into data attributes or IDs
- look into [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
- whatever we create should be built to last
