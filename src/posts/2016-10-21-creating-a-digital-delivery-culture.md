I’m a big fan of this [digital delivery culture poster](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday/status/657085783250227200), from [Ben Holliday](https://twitter.com/BenHolliday) and his team at [DWP Digital](https://twitter.com/DWPDigital) (Department for Work and Pensions).

Here are the points from the poster:

1. Work in the open
2. Share, not send
3. Right people, same room
4. Less process, more progress
5. Don’t wait for permission
6. Show the thing
7. People, not resources
8. Build strong communities
9. Fail fast and learn

## My thoughts

I like to look back over design principles like these every now and then. They help me to focus on what’s important. Creating a good culture is really hard, but it’s essential if you need individuals to work together as a team.
