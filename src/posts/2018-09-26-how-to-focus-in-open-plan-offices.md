I got some great responses (thanks everyone!) so I've captured them here for prosperity…

## Put on some headphones
- Get some headphones
- The bigger the better
- Noise cancelling ones are good
- Listen to white noise
- Or don't listen to anything – just wear them to discourage people from interrupting you

## Work from home
- That's it really, just work from home more

## Manage your calendar
- Block out slots in your calendar
- Decline non-essential meetings
- Plan to do focussed work when you're at your most productive – for me that's early in the morning

## Stop using distracting apps
- Put do not disturb on Slack
- Turn your emails off
- Use [Focus app](http://heyfocus.com/) to help

## Get away from your desk
- Book yourself a meeting room
- Use Skype pods and breakout spaces
- Hide in usability labs
- Find anywhere that's quiet or tucked away

## Be anti-social
- Scowl at people
- Put a hoodie on
- Put up 'do not disturb' signs
- Make sure people know you're busy

## Look after yourself
- Working in distracting environments can be stressful
- Don't ignore the problem
