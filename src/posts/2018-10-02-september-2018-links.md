  <dd>I care pretty deeply about accessible design. I wouldn’t call myself an accessibility specialist, mind you, but I’ve always felt that “designing for the web” means ensuring our work is accessible as broadly as possible.</dd>

  <dd>Picture the scene: you’ve just joined a new team, they’re doing good work but they’re plugging away at the wrong problem.  You bide your time, thinking of ways to bring them round.</dd>

  <dd>If you’ve ever worked on an app, you can only dream of that feeling of pure joy when you open the App Store and see your app featured on the homepage.</dd>

  <dd>If you’ve worked on a website design with a large team or client, chances are good you’ve spent some time debating (arguing?) with each other about what the homepage should look like, or which department gets to be in the top-lev</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://medium.com/@Ellayanor/team-charters-for-diverse-teams-a50add65dd92">Team Charters for Diverse&nbsp;Teams</a></dt>
  <dd>Team Charters are things which come up a lot, and are often triggers for really insightful conversations about how teams work together and function well. A team charter is basically a set of principles for how a group of people work as a team, that a team draft together and agree to abide by.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="http://www.jamiearnold.com/blog/2014/07/22/seven-questions-to-build-a-roadmap">Seven questions to build a roadmap</a></dt>
  <dd>In my last post I wrote about why roadmaps are for everyone. This post is about techniques for building one and how the use of language can help align your pure agile or mixed methodology programmes.</dd>

  <dd>There are lots of ways to build good teams and working relationships. But, before you get to the relational matter of teams, platforms and systems, it’s important for people to know your preferences as an individual.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/importance-manual-accessibility-testing/">The Importance Of Manual Accessibility Testing</a></dt>
  <dd>Automated accessibility tests are a great resource to have, but they can’t automatically make your site accessible. Use them as one step of a larger testing process.</dd>

  <dd>GDS’s Accessibility Empathy Lab is open to anyone from the public sector. Since we blogged about the lab, we’ve seen a huge increase in visitors coming in to use it as an assistive technology space.</dd>
