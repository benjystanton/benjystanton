<p>A quick round-up of the things we got up to at Swn.</p>

[Swn](http://swnfest.com/) is an alternative music festival in Cardiff. Bands play at different small, independent venues across Cardiff. Amazingly it's in its 12th year, but this is the first time I've ever been.

## Numbers
- 2 days
- 5 bands
- 8 venues

## Days

We got a weekend ticket, this includes entry to all the bands playing on Friday and Saturday night. The whole festival lasts 4 days – Wednesday to Saturday.


## Bands

We only managed to see 5 bands, this was partly down to us arriving too late and venues being full. We were also having too much fun. Our plans to see lots of bands went out the window.

## Venues

We did much better at venues. We went to 8 different venues across Cardiff. A lot of craft ale was drunk.

## Next time

I'd definitely recommend Swn, and I'm hoping to go again next year – and see a few more bands. It reminded me of [All Tomorrow's Parties](https://www.atpfestival.com/events), a music festival in Butlins (that was a lot better than it sounds).
