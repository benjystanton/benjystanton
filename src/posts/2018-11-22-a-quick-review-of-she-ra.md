<p class="lede">Netflix’s new She-Ra is seriously cool. The female characters are strong and diverse in personality, body shape and skin tone. Some are good, some are evil. Some are funny, some are serious, some are nerdy.</p>

The men are sensitive and supporting without being overtly masculine. Often they are camp and their sexuality is ambiguous.

It’s also funny, spooky and full of cool action sequences.

It’s the feminist cartoon series I’ve been waiting for.
