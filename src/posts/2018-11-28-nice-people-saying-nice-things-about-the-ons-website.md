<p>It was great to see some smart people, that I really respect, recognising the good work that we’re doing in ONS (Office for National Statistics) digital publishing today.</p>

Tom's original screenshot focused on a weirdly specific bit of something we did recently. But, even this small component went through some rigorous usability and A/B testing. It built upon a content pattern that already did a good job of meeting a clear user need (I need to know if I'm looking at the latest stuff).

The good news is, there is lots more of this to come. This is just the tiniest bit of the work we've been doing over the past year.
