## Laura’s leaving do

I’m writing these notes on my phone, on the train from Swansea to Cardiff. It’s [Laura’s](https://mobile.twitter.com/LauraFHarding) leaving do, so a few of us are heading to [Tiny Rebel](https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/bars/cardiff/). 

## Another check-in with Andy

Even though I’m no longer working for him, me and [Andy](https://mobile.twitter.com/mr_dudders) are continuing our one-to-ones.

This week I needed an extra one! As always, I’m thankful for his support.

## Website

We’re making a website for a thing in work and it’s finally making progress, thanks to [Leah’s](https://mobile.twitter.com/leahvardon) hard work. She has that great ability to pin people down and get them to make a decision.

Often in the civil service these kind of decisions can take weeks to make, so having people like Leah on your team is essential.

## Making plans for Service Design in Government

I’m [speaking at service design in government](https://govservicedesign.net/2019/sessions/index.php?session=102) next month with [Kieran](https://mobile.twitter.com/kieran_forde). We’re making headway with our talk outline and slides.

I finally sorted my flight and hotel arrangements too. Although thanks to the quirks of our self service portal I’m still not 100% sure if my conference ticket is paid for.

Note to self: completing the form that’s called "pay for a conference" does not by itself mean your conference will be paid for. Even if you have all the necessary approvals.

Snarky-ness aside, ONS really has a generous and supportive attitude to training and conference attendance.

## Making plans to shadow a field officer

After a recommendation from [Tom](https://mobile.twitter.com/drtommac), I’m trying to organise a day when I can shadow a field officer. 

These are the staff that [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) employ to go door-to-door and help people to fill in surveys. 

I’m expecting that observing this activity will be an amazing way to do user research and learn about our end-users and the needs of ONS staff.

## Forgot to mention my stand-up desk

I think I forgot to mention my stand-up desk in last week’s weeknotes. I’ve been using it for about 8 days so far and I’m really enjoying it. 

I don’t find it too tiring. And I feel more likely to walk around and chat to people rather than email or Slack them.

I assume it’s better for my health too, but I’m certainly not noticing any adverse effects so far.
