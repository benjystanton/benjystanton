<p class="lede">A list of big things that I’ve done over the past 10 years. Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/stfutony/status/1193954501620690944">that tweet</a>. Apologies for the self-congratulatory post.</p>

4. Worked at a design agency
5. Moved house

Joking aside… deciding to stop having kids was probably the hardest time for us. Even though we always planned to have 3, when we reached that point it was mentally very difficult.
