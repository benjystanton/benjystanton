Here are some tips on different user research techniques to try when you're testing user interface content ([crowdsourced from Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1247148638284980227
) – thanks everyone!).

- **[Highlighter test](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/02/a-simple-technique-for-evaluating-content/)** – Ask people to highlight easy-to-understand words, and confusing words, using different colours (via [Helen](https://twitter.com/SocialSoup) and many others)
- **Walkthrough** – Explain to someone how to use the thing (via [Paul Pod](https://twitter.com/paulpod))
- **Check search logs** – Check the search logs to see if people are looking for features that are right there in the interface (via [Mark Hurrell](https://twitter.com/markhurrell))
- **Task based usability test** – Start really minimal, find out what you need to add from research, it's much harder to find out what to remove or change (via [Joe Lanman](https://twitter.com/joelanman))
- **[Cloze test](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cloze-test-reading-comprehension/)** – Remove words from the content and ask people what the missing words should be (via [Kieran Forde](https://twitter.com/kieran_forde))
- **Memory test** – Show pages that fade to blank after a period of time and ask people what they remember (via [Grinchyface](https://twitter.com/retiredgrinch))
- **Eye tracking** – Measure how many times people's eyes stop on different words as they read (via [Fritz von Runte](https://twitter.com/vonRunte))
