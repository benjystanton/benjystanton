Back in December I decided to move this blog from GitHub and Jekyll, to Netlify and Eleventy (11ty). It's been over 5 years since I've done anything this drastic, when I [moved away from WordPress](/blog/goodbye-wordpress/).

My plan this time, after switching to Eleventy, was to publish the site (naked, without any styling) and then slowly iterate on the design and learn about modern CSS techniques as I go.

I've been chipping away at it slowly and you can read more about my progress in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benjystanton/status/1337685688259645441
), [these posts](/blog/category/release-notes/) and on my [GitHub project board](https://github.com/benjystanton/benjystanton.github.io/projects/2).

So, I'm finally ready to publish my progress. If you're reading this, then you're reading content generated by Eleventy. Hopefully everything will be the same, apart from the lack of CSS.

If you spot any issues, please let me know via [email](mailto:benjystanton@gmail.com) benjystanton@gmail.com.

Tomorrow is also [CSS naked day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/), which gave me the extra push I needed to get the redesign out there.
