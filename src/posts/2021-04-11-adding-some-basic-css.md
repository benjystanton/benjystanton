I've had an email from Google Search Console telling me that it's detected some Mobile Usability issues on the site. 

> The following issues were found on your site:
> - Content wider than screen
> - Text too small to read
> - Clickable elements too close together

So, I've added some very basic CSS for now, just to keep Google off my back.

I've increased the `font-size` and `line-height` and added some styles to stop images from being wider than the screen width.

I'm not sure this'll fix the last point (about clickable elements being too close together), we'll see.

I feel a bit bad for doing what Google says, instead of listening to, you know, users. But in this instance I agree with the things it's asking for. Also I don't want to harm my site's Search Engine ranking, as I've put so much effort into keeping the content structure the same so far.
