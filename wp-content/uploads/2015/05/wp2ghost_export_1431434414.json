I think the first ever digital animation that I created was actually on Mario Paint for SNES.\n\n[The Nativity (by me, aged 10) animated using Mario Paint on the SNES](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/66002457 \"The Nativity (on Vimeo)\")\n\n### University\n\nSo believe it or not, I actually ended up studying animation at University. I became became pretty handy at 3D Studio Max, Macromedia Flash and Adobe After Effects. Back then, I dreamt of becoming an animator and working for Pixar or Aardman, but after Uni, a friend of mine was starting a web design agency and offered me a job, and I\u2019ve been a web designer ever since.\n\nThe only piece of software I still use these days is Adobe After Effects. But the time I spent learning animation has stuck with me and often comes in useful when designing sites.\n\n### James Good\n\nThese days I work at James Good. James Good is a Corporate Branding & Communications Consultancy and we are made up of a team of designers, developers, photographers and copy writers. Whatever we do, we always try to focus on delivering strong conceptual designs, I think this is what makes our work successful.\n\nThings are going well, we have 2 offices (one in Swansea and one in London), 10 members of staff and a dog called Bailey (who is our HR and finance manager, so be sure to pay your invoices on time).\n\nMy main role as a designer is producing mock-ups for the websites that we create.\u00a0I like to get involved early on to help plan content, structure and the overall user experience,\u00a0I\u2019ll then work closely with the developers to get our sites built.\u00a0Even though\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0not a front-end developer, I like to think that I know my way around CSS and I use this skill mainly to annoy the developers at James Good.\n\n\n## Crafting\u00a0Animation\u00a0on the Web\n\nSo I\u2019m hear today to talk about \u2018Crafting Animation on the Web\u2019 and just in case your worried,\u00a0I\u2019m not going to be talking about making cartoons or even rotating home page banners.\u00a0I\u2019m interested in how animation can support and enhance our designs\u00a0\u2013 how we can use it to improve navigation, registration processes and contact forms,\u00a0animating between breakpoints and for progressively loading content.\n\n### F***h\n\nSo, firstly a little disclaimer\u2026\u00a0when I first contacted Joel to propose this talk I promised him that I wouldn\u2019t mention the F-word.\u00a0But I\u2019m afraid, that was a bit of a white lie, I am probably going to mention it a couple times.\u00a0Flash *was* a big part of animation on the web,\u00a0but, luckily we all know that it\u2019s days are numbered.\n\n### Animation is Immature\n\nPartly due to Flash, animation on the web still feels like a bit of a dirty phrase.\u00a0It\u2019s associated with annoying and down-right evil design patterns, like take-over adverts.\u00a0Saying that, there are plenty of great examples of site\u2019s out there that use animation really\u00a0well, but as a community I don\u2019t think we talk about it enough.\n\nAs a sub-discipline of web design, animation still quite immature.\u00a0Even though there are plenty of great articles explaining the technical specs\u00a0or examples that show off experimental ideas,\u00a0I don\u2019t feel there are enough resources out there to help people like us understand why, how and when we\u00a0should be using animation.\n\n### Animation as a\u00a0Design Material\n\nI love this idea, that animation is a design material (like typography or colour).\u00a0Not a type of content, that sits on our homepage, where users just click play, sit back and watch.\u00a0But as something that can be used throughout our sites to improve the way we interact with them.\n\n[Read more about this idea in another blog post](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/blog\/animation-as-a-design-material\/ \"Animation as a Design Material\").\n\n### Clean *and* Simple\n\nMovement can help keep our interfaces looking clean and simple.\u00a0We can reveal things with animation, so we don\u2019t need to show everything all at once.\u00a0We can also communicate and feedback to users, without having to add extra elements.\u00a0(e.g. the way that the OSX Lion sign-in form shakes from side to side when the\u00a0password\u00a0is\u00a0wrong.\u00a0This is just like somebody shaking their head from side-to-side to say no.\u00a0It\u2019s less cluttered and probably more universally understood than a bright red \u2018error\u2019 message\u00a0box.\n\n### The Time is Right\n\nThere are a few factors which make me think that the time is right to take animation more seriously. With relatively recent advances in web design like responsive design, mobile first design and touch interfaces, there are new patterns emerging on the web and many of them include movement. We\u2019ve also got native apps which are raising the bar on what user\u2019s expect from their devices. And lastly we have CSS animation, which is gaining support and allowing us to do more without javascript. A major benefit of CSS animation is that it can take advantage of hardware acceleration.\n\n\n## Animation\u00a0Principles\n\nI\u2019m going to run through some important animation principles\u00a0and also a brief history of the medium.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the\u00a0definition\u00a0of animation is\u2026\n\n> \u201cAnimation is the rapid\u00a0display of a sequence of\u00a0images to create an\u00a0illusion of movement.\u201d\n\nThe origin of the word has a deeper meaning though, and it means to bestow life.\u00a0And that\u2019s what animation is all about really: bringing inanimate things to life.\u00a0I think anything that we can do to make our stuff seem more alive, more human is definitely\u00a0worth our effort.\n\n> \u201c\u2026a bestowing of life.\u201d\n\nHuman beings have been have long been trying to convey motion in their artwork.\u00a0To bring them to life and to tell a story.\u00a0Some cave paintings are known to depict animals with \u00a0multiple legs, giving them the feeling of movement.\u00a0Ancient Egyptians and Greeks decorated pots and temples with\u00a0figures in various states of movement.\n\nI like to think of these as the pre-cursor to animated gifs.\n\n### Gertie the Dinosaur and Winsor McCay\n\nGertie the Dinosaur was animated by Winsor McCay who used to perform live in front the film, pretending to interact with Gertie. This special effect really astounding audiences back in 1914.\u00a0McCay pioneered many animation techniques that later became standard at Disney and elsewhere.\u00a0Many of the rules of classical animation were forged during this time, and are still relevant today.\n\n### Timing and Spacing\n\nTiming and spacing in animation is incredibly important. Movement should have a beat or a rhythm. When a bouncing ball hits the floor, that\u2019s our timing, we can think of these beats as keyframes. The bits in between, that\u2019s our spacing.\n\n### Easing\n\nIn \u2018real life\u2019 spacing is rarely is uniform, so in order to express believable movement we need to speed things up and slow them down.\n\n### Ease Out\n\n\u2018Ease out\u2019 means the animation will have a slow finish. The frames will bunch up at the end, cushioning the movement before stopping. So the animation will appear to slow down over time.\n\n### Ease In\n\n\u2018Ease\u00a0in\u2019 is the opposite. The animation will have a slow start before speeding up.\n\nEven though these ideas are just the basics, it\u2019s worth getting your head around what each one feels like so you can communicate and describe animations to your team.\n\n### Anticipation and Reaction\n\nAnticipation is another important part of animation. If the movement is going to the right, then we can start off by moving to the left slightly. For example if Bugs Bunny is about to do a runner, his body will \u2018coil up\u2019 (in the opposite direction to his imminent escape). It gives the audience an idea of what\u2019s coming next. It it also creates contrast between the stages of the movement for greater impact.\n\nReactions are the like the follow through from anticipation. When Bugs Bunny\u00a0runs away, perhaps he leaves a puff of smoke or some dust. This kind of visual gag is used in cartoons all the time for comedic effect, but it\u2019s basically a natural form of movement. If I jump up, I need to bend my knees first and crouch down. I move down before moving up.\n\nThere\u2019s a great little quote in one of my animation books and apparently it\u2019s from Charlie Chaplin\u2026\n\n1. Tell them what you\u2019re going to do.\n2. Do it.\n3. Tell them that you\u2019ve done it.\n\n### Testing\n\nTest, preview, iterate. It\u2019s a familiar mantra for web designers and it\u2019s the same for animators. I find when I\u2019m animating that I\u2019ll keep watching the same half-second clip over and over again tweaking and refining until it just feels right. It\u2019s pretty difficult to get an animation right first time.\n\n### Animade Lernz\n\n[Watch Animade Lernz on Vimeo](http:\/\/vimeo.com\/41558459 \"The Complete Animade Lernz\")\u00a0(01:46)\n\nAnimade are a London based Animation studio. This short clip is a great example of how animation, when done properly, can communicate so much. It shows a series of brief scenes, each animated twice, the first animated poorly, the second animated very well. It shows how mastering the art of animation can make all the difference.\n\nI highly recommend that you check out [Animade\u2019s website](http:\/\/animade.tv\/ \"Animade\u2019s Website\") for more examples of their work. Another personal favourite of mine is [30 Ways to Kill a Cowboy](http:\/\/vimeo.com\/28505330 \"Ready Steady Bang\") which is, as you\u2019d expect, an animation of a cowboy being killed 30 ways, it\u2019s not graphically violent though just pretty hysterical.\n\n\n## CSS Animation\n\nSo I\u2019m not going to go into a huge amount of detail with this, but I\u2019ll run through the basics and point out a few areas which I feel are important or maybe difficult to get you\u2019re head around initially.\n\nCSS Animations are made up of 2 main parts; the @Keyframe Rule and the Animation Property.\n\n### @Keyframes Rule\n\nThe @Keyframe Rule\u00a0is basically a list a frames that show what properties that you want to animate and in what order. I don\u2019t recommend that you try the following example out by the way, it will not look pretty.\n\n0% { color: crimson; }  \n 25% { color: sandybrown; }  \n 50% { color: gold; }  \n 75% { color: lawngreen; }  \n 100% { color: steelblue; }\n\n### Animation Property\n\nThen we have the Animation Property. I like to think if this as the controls for the playhead. How long will it takes to move along our list of keyframes. Is there a delay at the start? Does the animation repeat? That sort of stuff.\n\nname:  \n duration:  \n timing-function:  \n delay:  \n iteration-count:  \n direction:\n\n### timing-function:\n\nI think timing-function is the really important one here. This feature is more commonly referred to as easing, and it\u2019s a really important property that can have a massive effect the feel of your animation, so I urge you to take some time here. Although you can use some pre-defined types of easing, I prefer to create my own using the mysterious cubic-be\u0301zier function.\n\nLuckily, there are some really great tools on the web that we can use to draw cubic-be\u0301zier curves and then preview how they move. You don\u2019t need to be good at drawing, maths or French to have a go either. Just have a play, then when you are happy, grab the values it gives you and stick them into your CSS.\n\n- [matthewlein.com\/ceaser\/](http:\/\/matthewlein.com\/ceaser\/ \"Ceaser CSS Easing Animation Tool\")\n- [cubic-bezier.com](http:\/\/cubic-bezier.com\/ \"Cubic-bezier Tool\")\n\nThese tools are brilliant as they let you quickly test and revise timing and duration, plus you can create custom curves then copy and paste cubic-bezier values. They really take a lot of the pain and guess work out of animating, and I use them regularly.\n\n> Easing is one of those things that web designers don\u2019t talk about enough.\n> \n> <cite>\u2014Val Head<\/cite>\n\nI think lumping for a default ease-in or ease-out value is like choosing CSS\u2019s default red or blue for your design\u2019s colours. You just wouldn\u2019t do it, any designer worth their salt would spend ages picking the absolute right colour then copying and pasting that value into the CSS. We should be doing the same with easing.\n\n### timing-function: steps(10);\n\nAnother important part of the timing-function property (that is kind of hidden away) is \u2018steps\u2019 (no, it has nothing to do with the pop group Steps). Instead of our animation timing moving along a smooth cubic bezier curve, using steps will cause the animation to jump between a number of predefined steps with no in-betweens.\n\nThis could be used, for example, to artificially drop the frame rate, giving the animation a quirky, retro feel.\n\nOr, some clever folks have figured out that we can use steps to control animated sprites. Simply lay out all the frames of an animation into one sprite sheet, and animate the image\u2019s position using steps and hey presto, we have animated gifs 2.0. The advantage being we can control things like the speed and repetition using CSS.\n\n### [Minimal Monkey](http:\/\/minimalmonkey.com\/ \"Stephen Burgess\")\n\nMinimal Monkey is one of my favourite sites at the moment. It\u2019s a personal blog for Stephen Burgess who is a developer at Fantasy Interactive. It has a great minimal design with really strong use of type and colour. It\u2019s also noteworthy for the way it uses animation. The page transitions and hover states are simple but beautiful, and every bit of movement feels like it adds to the overall experience. Communicating a little bit about what will happen next.\n\n\n## Workflow\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, animation is probably something that gets left until the last moments of project. Perhaps by then it\u2019s too late to add anything but light touches and small improvements. But to use animation in a really meaningful way, I think it needs to be thought about and planned early on in the design process.\n\n### Animation Identity\n\nWhen you are planning out a project, give it an animation identity. Write down a list of words that reflect the brand or personality of your project, e.g. quick, happy, vintage, gamey, professional. Perhaps you could even gather a \u2018mood board\u2019 of clips that have right feel to their animation. These words and clips will help to inform the way in which your site moves. You may be doing something similar for other areas of the identity, such as copy, look & feel, photography etc so why not do it to describe animation too?\n\nIn Dan Cederholm\u2019s book CSS3 For Web Designers, he describes transitions (and animations) as \u2018butter\u2019 that can be used to smooth out the interactions in our site. This is a great idea, but I\u2019d like to add to this by saying that we don\u2019t always want things to move like butter, sometimes we want movement to be fluid like water, sticky like marmite, lumpy like porridge, or poppy like Rice Krispies. The breakfast-themed comparisons are potentially endless, but you get the idea: too many buttery animations have the same effect as too many rounded corners.\n\n### Notes\n\nAnnotation of your designs to describe desired movement is always a good idea. It\u2019s good to describe the animation in a way that matches up with the CSS properties that will need defining.\n\n- What property are changing? Colour, Position etc. (Subtle changes may not be obvious when looking at your mock-ups.)\n- How long you want the animation to last (think in milliseconds, as a second is a long time in animation)\n- What sort of easing would you like? (ease-in, ease-out, elastic bounce back?)\n- Should there be a delay before it starts?\n- How many times should it repeat?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t think of everything, and it will almost certainly need to be tweaked in the browser.\n\n### Show and Tell\n\nNotes are fine for simple animations, but what about more complicated things? The whole point of animation is that it communicates a lot in a short space of time. Sometimes, the best way to communicate an animated idea is to show it.\n\nAct things out! Either with your body, or use props and sketches on pieces of paper. If you\u2019ve ever watched a Pixar documentary you\u2019ll know that they act out movements using props and pull faces in front of mirrors. They even present their storyboards as if they were actors in the plot. The ability to act is very important for an animator.\n\n### Storyboards\n\nStoryboards are very similar to sketched wireframes. They consist of rough thumbnail sketches, with notes about the action and timing. We can also use arrows and other elements to show how objects, users and even the device viewport will react in certain scenarios. They certainly don\u2019t need to look beautiful, they should be quick and dirty.\n\n### Animatics (Moving Storyboards)\n\nAnimatics are like moving storyboards. To create one, you could scan in your storyboards, then use a basic video editing tool like iMovie to stitch them together. You will begin to get a feeling for the timing and duration of your animation. Sometimes I even separate out the background and foreground objects, so that I can move them independently of each other and create more detailed scenes.\n\n### Keynote\n\nThere have been a few people recently promoting keynote as an alternative, yet basic design package and it certainly has some merits, not least because it\u2019s able to produce simple animated and interactive prototypes.\n\n### Photoshop\n\nPhotoshop has a timeline view of course, it\u2019s handy for testing out frame-by-frame animations And a good tool for creating sprite sheets ready for animation.\n\n### Edge Animate\n\nI guess the jury is still out on Edge Animate. It\u2019s kind of Flash reborn isn\u2019t it, but using web technologies. You may not want to use it for production ready code, but as a tool for creating mock-ups it\u2019s definitely worth considering.\n\n### After Effects\n\nDan Mall has said that he uses Adobe After Effects to \u2018mock-up\u2019 his animations. So that he can can get the timing and feeling right, before handing them over to a developer.\n\nAlthough After Effects is a pretty expensive bit of kit by itself, these days Adobe\u2019s pricing structure is so that if you need 2 or 3 of their programs for 12 months, you may as well buy them all.\n\nSo if any of you have access to After Effects, I recommend you give it a try. It\u2019s kind of like Illustrator with a time line, and if you\u2019re at all familiar with Flash you\u2019ll probably feel right at home.\n\n### The Dream App\n\nSo what would the The Dream app be like? When working on the web, we\u2019re used to using a range of apps and services in order to get the job done, but I still would like something created specifically for animation. I guess this is what Adobe Edge Animate wants to be, but I\u2019m thinking more along the lines of a Typecast for animation.

I think the first ever digital animation that I created was actually on Mario Paint for SNES.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"The Nativity (on Vimeo)\" href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/66002457\">The Nativity (by me, aged 10) animated using Mario Paint on the SNES<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>University<\/h3>\n<p>So believe it or not, I actually ended up studying animation at University. I became became pretty handy at 3D Studio Max, Macromedia Flash and Adobe After Effects. Back then, I dreamt of becoming an animator and working for Pixar or Aardman, but after Uni, a friend of mine was starting a web design agency and offered me a job, and I\u2019ve been a web designer ever since.<\/p>\n<p>The only piece of software I still use these days is Adobe After Effects. But the time I spent learning animation has stuck with me and often comes in useful when designing sites.<\/p>\n<h3>James Good<\/h3>\n<p>These days I work at James Good. James Good is a Corporate Branding &amp; Communications Consultancy and we are made up of a team of designers, developers, photographers and copy writers. Whatever we do, we always try to focus on delivering strong conceptual designs, I think this is what makes our work successful.<\/p>\n<p>Things are going well, we have 2 offices (one in Swansea and one in London), 10 members of staff and a dog called Bailey (who is our HR and finance manager, so be sure to pay your invoices on time).<\/p>\n<p>My main role as a designer is producing mock-ups for the websites that we create.\u00a0I like to get involved early on to help plan content, structure and the overall user experience,\u00a0I&#8217;ll then work closely with the developers to get our sites built.\u00a0Even though\u00a0I&#8217;m\u00a0not a front-end developer, I like to think that I know my way around CSS and I use this skill mainly to annoy the developers at James Good.<\/p>\n<h2>Crafting\u00a0Animation\u00a0on the Web<\/h2>\n<p>So I&#8217;m hear today to talk about &#8216;Crafting Animation on the Web&#8217; and just in case your worried,\u00a0I&#8217;m not going to be talking about making cartoons or even rotating home page banners.\u00a0I&#8217;m interested in how animation can support and enhance our designs\u00a0\u2013 how we can use it to improve navigation, registration processes and contact forms,\u00a0animating between breakpoints and for progressively loading content.<\/p>\n<h3>F***h<\/h3>\n<p>So, firstly a little disclaimer&#8230;\u00a0when I first contacted Joel to propose this talk I promised him that I wouldn&#8217;t mention the F-word.\u00a0But I&#8217;m afraid, that was a bit of a white lie, I am probably going to mention it a couple times.\u00a0Flash <em>was<\/em> a big part of animation on the web,\u00a0but, luckily we all know that it\u2019s days are numbered.<\/p>\n<h3>Animation is Immature<\/h3>\n<p>Partly due to Flash, animation on the web still feels like a bit of a dirty phrase.\u00a0It&#8217;s associated with annoying and down-right evil design patterns, like take-over adverts.\u00a0Saying that, there are plenty of great examples of site&#8217;s out there that use animation really\u00a0well, but as a community I don&#8217;t think we talk about it enough.<\/p>\n<p>As a sub-discipline of web design, animation still quite immature.\u00a0Even though there are plenty of great articles explaining the technical specs\u00a0or examples that show off experimental ideas,\u00a0I don&#8217;t feel there are enough resources out there to help people like us understand why, how and when we\u00a0should be using animation.<\/p>\n<h3>Animation as a\u00a0Design Material<\/h3>\n<p>I love this idea, that animation is a design material (like typography or colour).\u00a0Not a type of content, that sits on our homepage, where users just click play, sit back and watch.\u00a0But as something that can be used throughout our sites to improve the way we interact with them.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Animation as a Design Material\" href=\"http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/blog\/animation-as-a-design-material\/\">Read more about this idea in another blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Clean <em>and<\/em> Simple<\/h3>\n<p>Movement can help keep our interfaces looking clean and simple.\u00a0We can reveal things with animation, so we don&#8217;t need to show everything all at once.\u00a0We can also communicate and feedback to users, without having to add extra elements.\u00a0(e.g. the way that the OSX Lion sign-in form shakes from side to side when the\u00a0password\u00a0is\u00a0wrong.\u00a0This is just like somebody shaking their head from side-to-side to say no.\u00a0It&#8217;s less cluttered and probably more universally understood than a bright red &#8216;error&#8217; message\u00a0box.<\/p>\n<h3>The Time is Right<\/h3>\n<p>There are a few factors which make me think that the time is right to take animation more seriously. With relatively recent advances in web design like responsive design, mobile first design and touch interfaces, there are new patterns emerging on the web and many of them include movement. We&#8217;ve also got native apps which are raising the bar on what user&#8217;s expect from their devices. And lastly we have CSS animation, which is gaining support and allowing us to do more without javascript. A major benefit of CSS animation is that it can take advantage of hardware acceleration.<\/p>\n<h2>Animation\u00a0Principles<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to run through some important animation principles\u00a0and also a brief history of the medium.<\/p>\n<p>According to Wikipedia, the\u00a0definition\u00a0of animation is&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Animation is the rapid\u00a0display of a sequence of\u00a0images to create an\u00a0illusion of movement.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The origin of the word has a deeper meaning though, and it means to bestow life.\u00a0And that&#8217;s what animation is all about really: bringing inanimate things to life.\u00a0I think anything that we can do to make our stuff seem more alive, more human is definitely\u00a0worth our effort.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;a bestowing of life.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Human beings have been have long been trying to convey motion in their artwork.\u00a0To bring them to life and to tell a story.\u00a0Some cave paintings are known to depict animals with \u00a0multiple legs, giving them the feeling of movement.\u00a0Ancient Egyptians and Greeks decorated pots and temples with\u00a0figures in various states of movement.<\/p>\n<p>I like to think of these as the pre-cursor to animated gifs.<\/p>\n<h3>Gertie the Dinosaur and Winsor McCay<\/h3>\n<p>Gertie the Dinosaur was animated by Winsor McCay who used to perform live in front the film, pretending to interact with Gertie. This special effect really astounding audiences back in 1914.\u00a0McCay pioneered many animation techniques that later became standard at Disney and elsewhere.\u00a0Many of the rules of classical animation were forged during this time, and are still relevant today.<\/p>\n<h3>Timing and Spacing<\/h3>\n<p>Timing and spacing in animation is incredibly important. Movement should have a beat or a rhythm. When a bouncing ball hits the floor, that\u2019s our timing, we can think of these beats as keyframes. The bits in between, that\u2019s our spacing.<\/p>\n<h3>Easing<\/h3>\n<p>In &#8216;real life&#8217; spacing is rarely is uniform, so in order to express believable movement we need to speed things up and slow them down.<\/p>\n<h3>Ease Out<\/h3>\n<p>\u2018Ease out\u2019 means the animation will have a slow finish. The frames will bunch up at the end, cushioning the movement before stopping. So the animation will appear to slow down over time.<\/p>\n<h3>Ease In<\/h3>\n<p>\u2018Ease\u00a0in\u2019 is the opposite. The animation will have a slow start before speeding up.<\/p>\n<p>Even though these ideas are just the basics, it\u2019s worth getting your head around what each one feels like so you can communicate and describe animations to your team.<\/p>\n<h3>Anticipation and Reaction<\/h3>\n<p>Anticipation is another important part of animation. If the movement is going to the right, then we can start off by moving to the left slightly. For example if Bugs Bunny is about to do a runner, his body will \u2018coil up\u2019 (in the opposite direction to his imminent escape). It gives the audience an idea of what&#8217;s coming next. It it also creates contrast between the stages of the movement for greater impact.<\/p>\n<p>Reactions are the like the follow through from anticipation. When Bugs Bunny\u00a0runs away, perhaps he leaves a puff of smoke or some dust. This kind of visual gag is used in cartoons all the time for comedic effect, but it\u2019s basically a natural form of movement. If I jump up, I need to bend my knees first and crouch down. I move down before moving up.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great little quote in one of my animation books and apparently it&#8217;s from Charlie Chaplin\u2026<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tell them what you\u2019re going to do.<\/li>\n<li>Do it.<\/li>\n<li>Tell them that you\u2019ve done it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Testing<\/h3>\n<p>Test, preview, iterate. It&#8217;s a familiar mantra for web designers and it&#8217;s the same for animators. I find when I&#8217;m animating that I&#8217;ll keep watching the same half-second clip over and over again tweaking and refining until it just feels right. It&#8217;s pretty difficult to get an animation right first time.<\/p>\n<h3>Animade Lernz<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"The Complete Animade Lernz\" href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/41558459\">Watch Animade Lernz on Vimeo<\/a>\u00a0(01:46)<\/p>\n<p>Animade are a London based Animation studio. This short clip is a great example of how animation, when done properly, can communicate so much. It shows a series of brief scenes, each animated twice, the first animated poorly, the second animated very well. It shows how mastering the art of animation can make all the difference.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend that you check out <a title=\"Animade\u2019s Website\" href=\"http:\/\/animade.tv\/\">Animade\u2019s website<\/a> for more examples of their work. Another personal favourite of mine is <a title=\"Ready Steady Bang\" href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/28505330\">30 Ways to Kill a Cowboy<\/a> which is, as you\u2019d expect, an animation of a cowboy being killed 30 ways, it\u2019s not graphically violent though just pretty hysterical.<\/p>\n<h2>CSS Animation<\/h2>\n<p>So I\u2019m not going to go into a huge amount of detail with this, but I\u2019ll run through the basics and point out a few areas which I feel are important or maybe difficult to get you\u2019re head around initially.<\/p>\n<p>CSS Animations are made up of 2 main parts; the @Keyframe Rule and the Animation Property.<\/p>\n<h3>@Keyframes Rule<\/h3>\n<p>The @Keyframe Rule\u00a0is basically a list a frames that show what properties that you want to animate and in what order. I don&#8217;t recommend that you try the following example out by the way, it will not look pretty.<\/p>\n<p>0% { color: crimson; }<br \/>\n25% { color: sandybrown; }<br \/>\n50% { color: gold; }<br \/>\n75% { color: lawngreen; }<br \/>\n100% { color: steelblue; }<\/p>\n<h3>Animation Property<\/h3>\n<p>Then we have the Animation Property. I like to think if this as the controls for the playhead. How long will it takes to move along our list of keyframes. Is there a delay at the start? Does the animation repeat? That sort of stuff.<\/p>\n<p>name:<br \/>\nduration:<br \/>\ntiming-function:<br \/>\ndelay:<br \/>\niteration-count:<br \/>\ndirection:<\/p>\n<h3>timing-function:<\/h3>\n<p>I think timing-function is the really important one here. This feature is more commonly referred to as easing, and it&#8217;s a really important property that can have a massive effect the feel of your animation, so I urge you to take some time here. Although you can use some pre-defined types of easing, I prefer to create my own using the mysterious cubic-be\u0301zier function.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there are some really great tools on the web that we can use to draw cubic-be\u0301zier curves and then preview how they move. You don&#8217;t need to be good at drawing, maths or French to have a go either. Just have a play, then when you are happy, grab the values it gives you and stick them into your CSS.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Ceaser CSS Easing Animation Tool\" href=\"http:\/\/matthewlein.com\/ceaser\/\">matthewlein.com\/ceaser\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Cubic-bezier Tool\" href=\"http:\/\/cubic-bezier.com\/\">cubic-bezier.com<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These tools are brilliant as they let you quickly test and revise timing and duration, plus you can create custom curves then copy and paste cubic-bezier values. They really take a lot of the pain and guess work out of animating, and I use them regularly.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Easing is one of those things that web designers don\u2019t talk about enough.<\/p>\n<p><cite>\u2014Val Head<\/cite><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I think lumping for a default ease-in or ease-out value is like choosing CSS\u2019s default red or blue for your design\u2019s colours. You just wouldn\u2019t do it, any designer worth their salt would spend ages picking the absolute right colour then copying and pasting that value into the CSS. We should be doing the same with easing.<\/p>\n<h3>timing-function: steps(10);<\/h3>\n<p>Another important part of the timing-function property (that is kind of hidden away) is \u2018steps\u2019 (no, it has nothing to do with the pop group Steps). Instead of our animation timing moving along a smooth cubic bezier curve, using steps will cause the animation to jump between a number of predefined steps with no in-betweens.<\/p>\n<p>This could be used, for example, to artificially drop the frame rate, giving the animation a quirky, retro feel.<\/p>\n<p>Or, some clever folks have figured out that we can use steps to control animated sprites. Simply lay out all the frames of an animation into one sprite sheet, and animate the image\u2019s position using steps and hey presto, we have animated gifs 2.0. The advantage being we can control things like the speed and repetition using CSS.<\/p>\n<h3><a title=\"Stephen Burgess\" href=\"http:\/\/minimalmonkey.com\/\">Minimal Monkey<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Minimal Monkey is one of my favourite sites at the moment. It\u2019s a personal blog for Stephen Burgess who is a developer at Fantasy Interactive. It has a great minimal design with really strong use of type and colour. It\u2019s also noteworthy for the way it uses animation. The page transitions and hover states are simple but beautiful, and every bit of movement feels like it adds to the overall experience. Communicating a little bit about what will happen next.<\/p>\n<h2>Workflow<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, animation is probably something that gets left until the last moments of project. Perhaps by then it\u2019s too late to add anything but light touches and small improvements. But to use animation in a really meaningful way, I think it needs to be thought about and planned early on in the design process.<\/p>\n<h3>Animation Identity<\/h3>\n<p>When you are planning out a project, give it an animation identity. Write down a list of words that reflect the brand or personality of your project, e.g. quick, happy, vintage, gamey, professional. Perhaps you could even gather a \u2018mood board\u2019 of clips that have right feel to their animation. These words and clips will help to inform the way in which your site moves. You may be doing something similar for other areas of the identity, such as copy, look &amp; feel, photography etc so why not do it to describe animation too?<\/p>\n<p>In Dan Cederholm&#8217;s book CSS3 For Web Designers, he describes transitions (and animations) as &#8216;butter&#8217; that can be used to smooth out the interactions in our site. This is a great idea, but I&#8217;d like to add to this by saying that we don&#8217;t always want things to move like butter, sometimes we want movement to be fluid like water, sticky like marmite, lumpy like porridge, or poppy like Rice Krispies. The breakfast-themed comparisons are potentially endless, but you get the idea: too many buttery animations have the same effect as too many rounded corners.<\/p>\n<h3>Notes<\/h3>\n<p>Annotation of your designs to describe desired movement is always a good idea. It\u2019s good to describe the animation in a way that matches up with the CSS properties that will need defining.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What property are changing? Colour, Position etc. (Subtle changes may not be obvious when looking at your mock-ups.)<\/li>\n<li>How long you want the animation to last (think in milliseconds, as a second is a long time in animation)<\/li>\n<li>What sort of easing would you like? (ease-in, ease-out, elastic bounce back?)<\/li>\n<li>Should there be a delay before it starts?<\/li>\n<li>How many times should it repeat?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t think of everything, and it will almost certainly need to be tweaked in the browser.<\/p>\n<h3>Show and Tell<\/h3>\n<p>Notes are fine for simple animations, but what about more complicated things? The whole point of animation is that it communicates a lot in a short space of time. Sometimes, the best way to communicate an animated idea is to show it.<\/p>\n<p>Act things out! Either with your body, or use props and sketches on pieces of paper. If you\u2019ve ever watched a Pixar documentary you\u2019ll know that they act out movements using props and pull faces in front of mirrors. They even present their storyboards as if they were actors in the plot. The ability to act is very important for an animator.<\/p>\n<h3>Storyboards<\/h3>\n<p>Storyboards are very similar to sketched wireframes. They consist of rough thumbnail sketches, with notes about the action and timing. We can also use arrows and other elements to show how objects, users and even the device viewport will react in certain scenarios. They certainly don\u2019t need to look beautiful, they should be quick and dirty.<\/p>\n<h3>Animatics (Moving Storyboards)<\/h3>\n<p>Animatics are like moving storyboards. To create one, you could scan in your storyboards, then use a basic video editing tool like iMovie to stitch them together. You will begin to get a feeling for the timing and duration of your animation. Sometimes I even separate out the background and foreground objects, so that I can move them independently of each other and create more detailed scenes.<\/p>\n<h3>Keynote<\/h3>\n<p>There have been a few people recently promoting keynote as an alternative, yet basic design package and it certainly has some merits, not least because it\u2019s able to produce simple animated and interactive prototypes.<\/p>\n<h3>Photoshop<\/h3>\n<p>Photoshop has a timeline view of course, it\u2019s handy for testing out frame-by-frame animations And a good tool for creating sprite sheets ready for animation.<\/p>\n<h3>Edge Animate<\/h3>\n<p>I guess the jury is still out on Edge Animate. It\u2019s kind of Flash reborn isn\u2019t it, but using web technologies. You may not want to use it for production ready code, but as a tool for creating mock-ups it\u2019s definitely worth considering.<\/p>\n<h3>After Effects<\/h3>\n<p>Dan Mall has said that he uses Adobe After Effects to &#8216;mock-up&#8217; his animations. So that he can can get the timing and feeling right, before handing them over to a developer.<\/p>\n<p>Although After Effects is a pretty expensive bit of kit by itself, these days Adobe&#8217;s pricing structure is so that if you need 2 or 3 of their programs for 12 months, you may as well buy them all.<\/p>\n<p>So if any of you have access to After Effects, I recommend you give it a try. It&#8217;s kind of like Illustrator with a time line, and if you&#8217;re at all familiar with Flash you&#8217;ll probably feel right at home.<\/p>\n<h3>The Dream App<\/h3>\n<p>So what would the The Dream app be like? When working on the web, we\u2019re used to using a range of apps and services in order to get the job done, but I still would like something created specifically for animation. I guess this is what Adobe Edge Animate wants to be, but I\u2019m thinking more along the lines of a Typecast for animation. Hopefully one day, somebody clever will make this for me!<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think of animation as a design material, not a piece of content.<\/li>\n<li>Use it to communicate more, without adding clutter to your designs.<\/li>\n<li>Use animation to give each project a unique personality.<\/li>\n<li>Animation is distracting, be mindful of people&#8217;s attention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"further-reading\">\n<h2>Further Reading<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn a bit more from some designers who know a lot more than me, I recommend the following articles (and book).<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"CSS: Animations with Val Head\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lynda.com\/CSS-tutorials\/CSS-Animations\/115434-2.html\">Lynda Tutorial on CSS Animations by Val Head<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Five Simple Steps\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fivesimplesteps.com\/products\/css-animations\">A Pocket Guide to CSS Animations by Val Head<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Transitional Interfaces (on Medium)\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/design-ux\/926eb80d64e3\">Transitional Interfaces by Pasquale D\u2019Silva<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"A New Mobile UX Design Material (on Smashing Magazine)\" href=\"http:\/\/uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com\/2012\/10\/30\/motion-animation-new-mobile-ux-design-material\/\">A New Mobile UX Design Material by Rachel Hinman<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Flashless Animation (on 24 Ways)\" href=\"http:\/\/24ways.org\/2012\/flashless-animation\/\">Flashless Animation by Rachel Nabors<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Better Navigation Through Proprioception (on A List Apart)\" href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/column\/better-navigation-through-proprioception\">Better Navigation Through Proprioception by Cennydd Bowles<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"The Animator's Survival Kit (on Wikipedia)\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Animator's_Survival_Kit\">The Animator&#8217;s Survival Kit by Richard Williams<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 14 May 2013 00:53:32 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 13:53:14 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 14 May 2013 00:53:32 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":349,"title":"Stickiness and Lumpy Bits","slug":"stickiness-and-lumpy-bits","markdown":"\nI really enjoyed Andy Davies\u2019 talk on mobile site performance at Port80 2013, but one fact in particular stood out for me\u2026\n\n> \u201cFacebook artificially slowed down scrolling from 60fps to 30fps.

If you are working alongside a developer, they will appreciate you taking some time think about these properties. You could scribble your notes on a piece of paper, or add them as a layer to your design file, whatever floats your boat.\n\nBasically CSS animations are made up of two parts; a list of keyframes and a list of animation properties.\u00a0If you think of your keyframes as your timeline or storyboard, then the animation property controls the way that the playhead moves along your timeline.\n\n\n## The list\u2026\n\n1. Name\n2. Duration\n3. Timing Function\n4. Delay\n5. Iteration Count\n6. Direction\n\n\n## Name\n\nYour animation needs a name. I like to use a simple name that describes the kind of movement that we\u2019ll see, but don\u2019t be too specific as we may end applying the animation to more than one element,\n\n\n## Duration\n\nDuration and name are the two properties that you must include for your animation to work. Duration defines how long your animation will last in seconds or milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds). A lot can happen in a second of animation. I find that simple interface animations last less than a second.\n\n\n## Timing Function\n\nThe timing-function property controls the acceleration (or deceleration) of your animation. No matter what you set it to, the animation will still have the same Duration. You can set your animations to speed up or slow down over time or just pootle along at a constant speed.\n\nThis feature is more commonly referred to in animation as easing, and it\u2019s a really important property that can massively effect the feel of your animation, so I urge you to take some time here. Although you can use some pre-defined types of easing, I prefer to design my own using the mysterious cubic-b\u00e9zier function.\n\nLuckily, there are some really great tools on the web that we can use to draw cubic-b\u00e9zier curves and then preview how they move. We don\u2019t need to be good at drawing, maths or French to have a go either. Just have a play, then when you are happy, copy the values.\n\n- cubic-bezier.com\n- matthewlein.com\/ceaser\/\n\n\n## Delay\n\nDelay can be used to make your animation wait a few seconds (or milliseconds) before it starts. Interestingly it can be a negative value too, which means your animation will get a jump start, however I can\u2019t really think of a useful application for a negative delay right now.\n\n\n## Iteration Count\n\nThis defines how many times the animation will play. Perhaps obviously, it defaults to 1. You may want an animation to repeat infinitely, or run just 5 times for example.\n\n\n## Direction\n\nThis specifies whether you want the animation to play normally (first keyframe first, last keyframe last) or in reverse. You can even specify it to work alternately so it will repeat back and fore.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Here&#8217;s a quick guide for designers\u00a0to the CSS animation property.\u00a0I like to keep this handy and refer to it whenever I\u2019m designing animations.

Hopefully it goes without saying that scribbling on paper happens a lot too. I use an iMac, iPad and iPhone, so some of the following will be iOS\/OSX only.\n\n\n## [iA Writer](http:\/\/www.iawriter.com\/)\n\niA Writer is my text editor of choice. Most projects start here and it\u2019s especially suited to long-form writing. The stripped back interface and large type make it easy to use. It supports [Markdown](http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/), so I get just enough formatting options, without the distraction of a fully blown word processor. Markdown is a great way to write basic html too.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n- I use Apple\u2019s Notes app a lot for when I want to scribble something down quickly. I rely on the fact that it gets synced with all my devices.\n- [Editorially](http:\/\/editorially.com) is a great web based alternative to iA Writer. Currently still in beta, it has some really neat features such as versioning and multiple editors.\n\n\n## [Divvy](http:\/\/mizage.com\/divvy\/)\n\nDivvy is little menu bar application that allows you to quickly snap your application windows to a grid. I like to have my applications fill the screen neatly, and if you have 2 or more apps open together at the same time, Divvy can help you to line everything up nicely. I\u2019ve customised my Divvy grid to have 6 columns and just 1 row.\n\n\n## [Dropbox](http:\/\/www.dropbox.com)\n\nI use Dropbox for all sorts of things. It\u2019s a quick and dirty way to share websites in development, and a good place to stick images temporarily when you want to test them out on a live site (stick them in your public folder, then use web inspector to pull them in).\n\nI also use it a lot when design checking sites. First I\u2019ll run through a site on my iPhone and iPad taking screenshots as I go. Then when I plug my device into the computer, all the screenshots get downloaded, ready for annotation.\n\n\n## [Alfred](http:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/)\n\nAlfred is another little menu bar app that lets you launch apps by typing their name. When you get used to it, it\u2019s much quicker than clicking on the dock or even using Spotlight search. I\u2019m only just scratching the surface with Alfred and there are loads of ways you can use it to be more productive.\n\nThe calculator is especially handy, just type your sum and press enter to copy the result to your clipboard. Perfect for handling those pesky responsive web design numbers that have a hundred decimal places.\n\n\n## [Illustrator](http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/uk\/products\/illustrator.html)\n\nAt [James Good](http:\/\/www.jamesgood.co.uk) we use Adobe Illustrator to mock-up our website designs and create assets. It has some nice features that suit a modern web design work flow, like multiple pages (shown side-by-side in one document), global colour swatches and text styles. Plus it is resolution independent, just like the web.\n\n### Alternatives\n\n- [Photoshop](http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/uk\/products\/photoshop.html), despite coming under some criticism recently (see [The Post-PSD Era](http:\/\/bradfrostweb.com\/blog\/post\/the-post-psd-era\/) and [Photoshop you are a liar](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/67897293)) is receiving some nice updates, such as better text rendering and an asset generation tool.\n- [Sketch](http:\/\/www.bohemiancoding.com\/sketch\/) is fast gaining a reputation as a lightweight and affordable alternative to Adobe\u2019s big fatties, although I haven\u2019t had a chance to really play with it yet.\n\n\n## [LiveView](http:\/\/www.zambetti.com\/projects\/liveview\/)\n\nLiveView is a free app that you run on OSX and iOS simultaneously. It mirrors a portion of you Mac\u2019s screen in realtime to your iPhone screen, so you can quickly preview how your design will look. In my experience, seeing a design on your phone feels *completely different* to seeing it mocked up on a desktop computer.\n\n\n## [ImageOptim](http:\/\/imageoptim.com\/)\n\nImageOptim compresses images for the web much better than Illustrator or Photoshop can. Simply drag and drop a load of files onto the app and it will churn through them, automatically saving over the originals, and giving you a report on how many KBs have been saved. This is a no-brainer really, I always run my images through this before uploading.\n\n\n## [ImageAlpha](http:\/\/pngmini.com\/)\n\nImageAlpha allows you to create 8bit PNGs with 24bit alpha transparencies. 24bit PNGs with alpha are probably the heaviest image type on the web, so it\u2019s worth trying to crunch them down a bit. Depending on the image, I have found that ImageAlpha can give huge savings in file weight. Watch out for images with subtle gradients and shadows though as it can cause banding. Use with care.\n\n\n## [Chrome Developer Tools](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/chrome-developer-tools\/)\n\nI use developer tools to try out HTML and CSS changes on the fly, before feeding back to the developers. It\u2019s perfect for adjusting things like typography and animation, as well as trying out new content in place.\n\nI learnt recently that you should [dock your inspector to the right](http:\/\/www.welcomebrand.co.uk\/thoughts\/docking-inspector-for-responsive-design-testing\/), so you can adjust the width of the viewport quickly when testing responsive designs. (Remember kids: nothing beats testing on real devices.)\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to use [Developer Tools on Safari on your iOS device](http:\/\/webdesign.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/workflow-tutorials\/quick-tip-using-web-inspector-to-debug-mobile-safari\/) (via a Mac), and it\u2019s pretty simple to setup.\n\n### Alternatives \/ Extras\n\n- [WhatFont](http:\/\/chengyinliu.com\/whatfont.html) is a quick way to check a site\u2019s typography.\n- [Web Developer Toolbar](http:\/\/chrispederick.com\/work\/web-developer\/) is a collection of very helpful tools. A modern classic.\n\n\n## [Ghostlab](http:\/\/vanamco.com\/ghostlab\/)\n\nGhostlab lets you test websites on multiple devices at the same time. If you update the HTML or CSS, all devices will refresh to show your changes. If you scroll down or visit a different page, each device will stay in sync too. Definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.\n\n\n## [Trello](https:\/\/trello.com\/)\n\nI\u2019ve found Trello is a great tool for design checking and bug tracking, and we use it at James Good to keep on top of big web projects. It\u2019s especially useful when a team is spread out and managing a wall of post-its becomes unwieldy.\n\n\n## Honourable Mentions\n\nAlthough not strictly part of my web design workflow, these apps help me stay organised and\/or up to date with what\u2019s going on in the world.\n\n- [Mailbox](http:\/\/www.mailboxapp.com\/)\n- [Fantastical](http:\/\/flexibits.com\/fantastical-iphone)\n- [Readmill](https:\/\/readmill.com\/)\n- [Pocket](http:\/\/getpocket.com)\n- [Tweetdeck](https:\/\/about.twitter.com\/products\/tweetdeck)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Here is a run down of the tools that make up my web design process.

Plus it is resolution independent, just like the web.<\/p>\n<h3>Alternatives<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/uk\/products\/photoshop.html\">Photoshop<\/a>, despite coming under some criticism recently (see <a href=\"http:\/\/bradfrostweb.com\/blog\/post\/the-post-psd-era\/\">The Post-PSD Era<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/67897293\">Photoshop you are a liar<\/a>) is receiving some nice updates, such as better text rendering and an asset generation tool.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bohemiancoding.com\/sketch\/\">Sketch<\/a> is fast gaining a reputation as a lightweight and affordable alternative to Adobe\u2019s big fatties, although I haven\u2019t had a chance to really play with it yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zambetti.com\/projects\/liveview\/\">LiveView<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>LiveView is a free app that you run on OSX and iOS simultaneously. It mirrors a portion of you Mac\u2019s screen in realtime to your iPhone screen, so you can quickly preview how your design will look. In my experience, seeing a design on your phone feels <em>completely different<\/em> to seeing it mocked up on a desktop computer.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http:\/\/imageoptim.com\/\">ImageOptim<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>ImageOptim compresses images for the web much better than Illustrator or Photoshop can. Simply drag and drop a load of files onto the app and it will churn through them, automatically saving over the originals, and giving you a report on how many KBs have been saved. This is a no-brainer really, I always run my images through this before uploading.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http:\/\/pngmini.com\/\">ImageAlpha<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>ImageAlpha allows you to create 8bit PNGs with 24bit alpha transparencies. 24bit PNGs with alpha are probably the heaviest image type on the web, so it\u2019s worth trying to crunch them down a bit. Depending on the image, I have found that ImageAlpha can give huge savings in file weight. Watch out for images with subtle gradients and shadows though as it can cause banding. Use with care.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/chrome-developer-tools\/\">Chrome Developer Tools<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>I use developer tools to try out HTML and CSS changes on the fly, before feeding back to the developers. It\u2019s perfect for adjusting things like typography and animation, as well as trying out new content in place.<\/p>\n<p>I learnt recently that you should <a href=\"http:\/\/www.welcomebrand.co.uk\/thoughts\/docking-inspector-for-responsive-design-testing\/\">dock your inspector to the right<\/a>, so you can adjust the width of the viewport quickly when testing responsive designs. (Remember kids: nothing beats testing on real devices.)<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible to use <a href=\"http:\/\/webdesign.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/workflow-tutorials\/quick-tip-using-web-inspector-to-debug-mobile-safari\/\">Developer Tools on Safari on your iOS device<\/a> (via a Mac), and it\u2019s pretty simple to setup.<\/p>\n<h3>Alternatives \/ Extras<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/chengyinliu.com\/whatfont.html\">WhatFont<\/a> is a quick way to check a site\u2019s typography.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/chrispederick.com\/work\/web-developer\/\">Web Developer Toolbar<\/a> is a collection of very helpful tools. A modern classic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><a href=\"http:\/\/vanamco.com\/ghostlab\/\">Ghostlab<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Ghostlab lets you test websites on multiple devices at the same time. If you update the HTML or CSS, all devices will refresh to show your changes. If you scroll down or visit a different page, each device will stay in sync too. Definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve found Trello is a great tool for design checking and bug tracking, and we use it at James Good to keep on top of big web projects. It\u2019s especially useful when a team is spread out and managing a wall of post-its becomes unwieldy.<\/p>\n<h2>Honourable Mentions<\/h2>\n<p>Although not strictly part of my web design workflow, these apps help me stay organised and\/or up to date with what\u2019s going on in the world.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mailboxapp.com\/\">Mailbox<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/flexibits.com\/fantastical-iphone\">Fantastical<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/readmill.com\/\">Readmill<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/getpocket.com\">Pocket<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/about.twitter.com\/products\/tweetdeck\">Tweetdeck<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:31:25 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 15:49:38 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 22:31:25 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":494,"title":"My Name Is Benjy and I\u2019m a Web Designer","slug":"my-name-is-benjy-and-im-a-web-designer","markdown":"\nThese words have been sitting in my \u2018finish up and publish\u2019 pile for almost two years and\u00a0*finally*\u00a0I\u2019ve been inspired to do just that this week, after listening to [Unfinished Business](http:\/\/unfinished.bz\/ \"Unfinished Business podcast\") and then [The Freelance Web](http:\/\/www.thefreelanceweb.com\/ \"The Freelance Web podcast\").

But, for one reason or another, I\u2019ve always been in denial. I\u2019ve preferred to call myself a graphic designer or a designer-who-works-on-the-web or even a UI and UX designer.

Then, I got hooked on blogging, and it was whilst fumbling my way through WordPress templates that I got my first taste of CSS.\n\nIt was also at Web Media Works that I discovered [Jeffrey Zeldman](http:\/\/www.zeldman.com\/ \"Jeffrey Zeldman\u2019s website\")\u2019s article Style Versus Design. At the time, I found it very challenging, but it has come to form the basis of my views on design. After following Jeffrey, I soon discovered [Andy Clarke](http:\/\/stuffandnonsense.co.uk\/ \"Andy Clarke\u2019s Stuff & Nonsense\"), and I was pretty excited to find out that he was local(ish). I think that I even emailed Andy, congratulating him on being a great web standards evangelist here in Wales (cringe).\n\nAfter a few years at Web Media Works, I fell into freelancing. I felt that offering print design services alongside web stuff would help strengthen my ability as a graphic designer (something I had never formally trained in). I soon realised however that the web design skills that I\u2019d developed were often more effective (and more in demand). I began building the sites that I was mocking up, first in flat HTML\/CSS and then by building WordPress themes (based on Starkers).\n\n\n## My Peoples\n\nFast forward a few years and I had joined [James Good](http:\/\/www.jamesgood.co.uk\/ \"James Good\"), based in Swansea.\n\nLate during 2011, James won two tickets to [New Adventures](http:\/\/2012.newadventuresconf.com\/ \"New Adventures Conference 2012\") in Nottingham. Knowing my passion for web design, he offered me first dibs on the other ticket. I gratefully accepted, even though the previous year\u2019s conference had completely passed me by. We made our way up to Nottingham (driving part of the way along the tram lines) without knowing what to expect.\n\nWhen we arrived, I remember saying to James (only half-jokingly) <q>\u201cthese are my people\u201d<\/q>. They were *designers*, the shaggy haircuts, scruffy trainers and button badges confirmed that much, but they were *web* too. Web designers.

Here are my notes on how to create and upload those images for good\u00a0results. (Pssst, these things change all the time, so this may be out of date already.)\n\n\n## Twitter\n\n### Profile Photo: 512 x 512, PNG\n\nA\u00a024 bit PNG does the trick here (even though it appears Twitter\u2019s servers do save it as a JPEG on upload for you). 512 pixels seems to be the biggest that it\u2019s ever displayed (when a user clicks on your Profile Photo is gets enlarged).\n\n### Header Photo: 1500 x 500, PNG\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve used a\u00a0large 24 bit PNG (JPEGs suffer from some ugly compression artefacts when they get uploaded to Twitter\u2019s servers). 1500 x 500 pixels seems to be the magic number, but as the new Twitter profile pages are responsive, the ratio of the image changes quite a lot (sometimes it is wider, sometimes it is taller) so make sure you leave\u00a0a generous \u2018safe zone\u2019 around the edges.\n\n\n## Google+\n\n### Profile Photo: 869\u00a0x 869, PNG\n\nWhen a user clicks your Profile Photo, a large version is loaded up in a modal, the size seems to be capped at 869 x 869 pixels. Note that Google+ crops Profile Photos\u00a0into circles,\u00a0so bear that in mind if you don\u2019t have a face\/logo that fits neatly into a circle.\n\n### Cover Photo: 1177\u00a0x\u00a0661, PNG\n\nSimilarly to the Profile Photos, Cover Photos seem to be\u00a0capped at 1177 x 661 pixels when viewed in the Google+ modal. But this size is more than big enough when viewing the Profile page, it\u2019s the ratio which is more important here. On larger viewports The Cover Photo is duplicated and blurred and then used as a background for your Profile Photo, this can have strange effects, so it\u2019s worth testing out. Note that on smaller viewports the layout changes, the Profile Photo appears centrally aligned at the bottom of the Cover Photo, obscuring part of it.\n\n\n## Facebook\n\n### Profile Picture: 520\u00a0x 520, PNG\n\nI found that uploading a 24 bit PNG\u00a0at a larger resolution than the recommended 180 x 180 pixels gave better results. I upped it to 520 x 520 pixels, so that when a user clicks your Profile Picture, it fills the modal window (smaller photos have big black borders).\n\n### Cover Photo: 851 x 520,\u00a0JPEG (will require cropping on upload)\n\n[Facebook\u2019s own tips](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/www\/125379114252045 \"Cover Photo tips\") were actually pretty good for this one. If you can save out your image as a JPEG (with\u00a0sRGB ticked) and keep the file size below 100KB you should get a good quality image that loads quickly. I saved out my image at 520 pixels in height (which is taller than recommended) so that when a user clicks it, it will fill the modal window. Alternatively, Facebook\u00a0suggest that PNGs will probably look\u00a0better if you have text in the image.\n\n\n## General Notes\n\n- More often than not, creating a 24 bit PNG that is bigger than required will offer you the best results.\n- The\u00a0uploaders seem to like files with\u00a0their filename extension (eg .png or .jpg) so make sure you add one on if it\u2019s missing.\n- Profile page\u00a0layouts are updated regularly and they are designed to be\u00a0viewed on multiple devices, so keep things simple.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been creating a lot of images for Twitter, Google+ and Facebook profile pages recently.

I work from home now, and even though I have freelanced before, I\u2019m finding it harder this time to a draw a line between work life and family life.\n\nHanging out on Twitter and reading blog posts used to be my hobby, and I\u2019d quite happily spend an evening glued to my iPad chatting with friends or catching up with new techniques and tools. But now that I am working for myself that all feels too much like work. I\u2019ve tried ignoring my iDevices *and* I\u2019ve tried letting myself use them as much as I want. Both methods seem to me leave me stressed, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m achieving anything useful in return.\n\nSo last Friday afternoon I decided to [ask people on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/benjystanton\/status\/472389216782262272) for some tips\u2026\n\n> Guys, what are your tips for switching off from work in the evenings and over the weekend?\n\nIt got a great response (mainly because [Stu Robson](https:\/\/twitter.com\/StuRobson) retweeted it) and loads of people replied with their tips for switching off.\n\nHere is a round-up of what people said\u2026\n\n\n## Watch the telly\n\nStu suggested \u201ccrap telly\u201d, which of course I watch a lot of, but I\u2019m finding that unless I\u2019m really enjoying something my mind starts to wander and I begin thinking about business issues like cash flow, difficult projects and tax returns.\n\n[Marc Drummond](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarcDrummond) suggested Netflix, which is probably a better idea as I still haven\u2019t watched any Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones or Orange Is the New Black. There is a whole load of distraction waiting for me right there.\n\n[Liam Jay](https:\/\/twitter.com\/liamjay66) suggested (amongst other things): console gaming. This was my favourite screen based suggestion. Most of my life I have been massively into gaming, especially Nintendo consoles, and I\u2019ve been thinking it\u2019s a hobby that\u2019s worth rediscovering. There are a whole load of Mario games on the Wii U that have completely passed me by, my teenage self would not be impressed.\n\nThe problem with these suggestions is that I should probably be looking for something that doesn\u2019t involve sitting down, staring at a screen. My poor body is craving a different kind of activity.\n\n\n## Turn off notifications\n\n[Adam Whitcroft](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AdamWhitcroft), [Bevan Stephens](https:\/\/twitter.com\/bevan7) and [Patrick Fulton](https:\/\/twitter.com\/patrickfulton) all suggested variations on the theme of turning off notifications (and emails and social networks etc). This is something I am trying (is it just me or are the Notification Settings on iOS a pain in arse to figure out?). It helps, but I think I am actually addicted to those little pings of happiness and I don\u2019t have the will power to stop checking for them every 10 minutes.\n\n\n## Get outside and exercise\n\n[Gary Lake](https:\/\/twitter.com\/GaryLake) replied simply \u201cbikes innit\u201d and others suggested outdoor activities and sports too. My personal favourite was from [Andy Davies](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AndyDavies) who grows vegetables \u2014 that\u2019s something I can see myself getting into.\n\n\n## Have a drink\n\n[Richard Baker](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richlybaked), [Keiron Skillet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Keiron) and [John Coyne](https:\/\/twitter.com\/aoimedia)\u00a0all suggested having a drink, which is exactly what I did on Friday evening and it definitely helped. Again, the health implications of this one are slightly dubious, but they say a glass of red wine every night does you good right? Plus a night out every now and then blows away the cobwebs and helps you to reset yourself back to zero, I think.\n\n\n## Spend time with friends and family\n\n[Sanjay Poyzer](https:\/\/twitter.com\/sanjaypoyzer) came up with probably my favourite\u2026\n\n> hang out with friends who don\u2019t understand what you do\n\nThis was backed up Bevan Stephens who also suggested \u201cnon-work friends\u201d and \u201cbabies\u201d. I have two little girls who I love spending time with and they definitely distract me from work, but part of the problem is how\u00a0my home life and work life have merged, so I need to do more things with them away from the house.\n\nIt\u2019s probably cheating but I have been trying to hang out with non-work friends by going on Facebook more in the evenings and leaving Twitter for \u2018work\u2019 friends during the day. These seems to be helping create more of a separation and still allows me to feed my addiction for notifications.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWatching more telly and having a drink are easy solutions, but they probably don\u2019t do much to address the actual problem. I think that combining the other three main points (turning off notifications, hanging out with non-work friends and getting some exercise) are the way to go.\n\nTime to dust off the surfboard I think.\n\n[![My lonely surfboard](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/8bb1095acda411e1b9a5123138140995_7.jpg)](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/8bb1095acda411e1b9a5123138140995_7.jpg)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Since going freelance last February I\u2019ve found it incredibly difficult to switch off when I\u2019m not \u201cin work\u201d (hence writing this blog post at 11:30 on a Monday night).

Both methods seem to me leave me stressed, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m achieving anything useful in return.<\/p>\n<p>So last Friday afternoon I decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benjystanton\/status\/472389216782262272\">ask people on Twitter<\/a> for some tips\u2026<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Guys, what are your tips for switching off from work in the evenings and over the weekend?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It got a great response (mainly because <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StuRobson\">Stu Robson<\/a> retweeted it) and loads of people replied with their tips for switching off.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a round-up of what people said\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Watch the telly<\/h2>\n<p>Stu suggested \u201ccrap telly\u201d, which of course I watch a lot of, but I\u2019m finding that unless I\u2019m really enjoying something my mind starts to wander and I begin thinking about business issues like cash flow, difficult projects and tax returns.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarcDrummond\">Marc Drummond<\/a> suggested Netflix, which is probably a better idea as I still haven\u2019t watched any Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones or Orange Is the New Black. There is a whole load of distraction waiting for me right there.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/liamjay66\">Liam Jay<\/a> suggested (amongst other things): console gaming. This was my favourite screen based suggestion. Most of my life I have been massively into gaming, especially Nintendo consoles, and I\u2019ve been thinking it\u2019s a hobby that\u2019s worth rediscovering. There are a whole load of Mario games on the Wii U that have completely passed me by, my teenage self would not be impressed.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with these suggestions is that I should probably be looking for something that doesn\u2019t involve sitting down, staring at a screen. My poor body is craving a different kind of activity.<\/p>\n<h2>Turn off notifications<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AdamWhitcroft\">Adam Whitcroft<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bevan7\">Bevan Stephens<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/patrickfulton\">Patrick Fulton<\/a> all suggested variations on the theme of turning off notifications (and emails and social networks etc). This is something I am trying (is it just me or are the Notification Settings on iOS a pain in arse to figure out?). It helps, but I think I am actually addicted to those little pings of happiness and I don\u2019t have the will power to stop checking for them every 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<h2>Get outside and exercise<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GaryLake\">Gary Lake<\/a> replied simply \u201cbikes innit\u201d and others suggested outdoor activities and sports too. My personal favourite was from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AndyDavies\">Andy Davies<\/a> who grows vegetables \u2014 that\u2019s something I can see myself getting into.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a drink<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richlybaked\">Richard Baker<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Keiron\">Keiron Skillet<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aoimedia\">John Coyne<\/a>\u00a0all suggested having a drink, which is exactly what I did on Friday evening and it definitely helped. Again, the health implications of this one are slightly dubious, but they say a glass of red wine every night does you good right? Plus a night out every now and then blows away the cobwebs and helps you to reset yourself back to zero, I think.<\/p>\n<h2>Spend time with friends and family<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sanjaypoyzer\">Sanjay Poyzer<\/a> came up with probably my favourite\u2026<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>hang out with friends who don&#8217;t understand what you do<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This was backed up Bevan Stephens who also suggested \u201cnon-work friends\u201d and \u201cbabies\u201d. I have two little girls who I love spending time with and they definitely distract me from work, but part of the problem is how\u00a0my home life and work life have merged, so I need to do more things with them away from the house.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably cheating but I have been trying to hang out with non-work friends by going on Facebook more in the evenings and leaving Twitter for \u2018work\u2019 friends during the day. These seems to be helping create more of a separation and still allows me to feed my addiction for notifications.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Watching more telly and having a drink are easy solutions, but they probably don\u2019t do much to address the actual problem. I think that combining the other three main points (turning off notifications, hanging out with non-work friends and getting some exercise) are the way to go.<\/p>\n<p>Time to dust off the surfboard I think.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/8bb1095acda411e1b9a5123138140995_7.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-775 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/8bb1095acda411e1b9a5123138140995_7.jpg\" alt=\"My lonely surfboard\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 02 Jun 2014 23:48:20 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 03 Jun 2014 09:09:03 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 02 Jun 2014 23:48:20 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":872,"title":"Longbridge Device Lab","slug":"longbridge-device-lab","markdown":"\nI\u2019m working with [Ballyhoo](http:\/\/www.ballyhoo.co.uk\/), a web development agency in Birmingham, to design an identity and website for their\u00a0upcoming [Open Device Lab](http:\/\/opendevicelab.com\/)\u00a0called [Longbridge Device Lab](http:\/\/longbridgedevicelab.co.uk\/).

emails","slug":"making-responsive-html-emails","markdown":"\nThis is a run down of my process for designing, building and testing responsive HTML emails. I\u2019ve also included lots of links to articles and resources for further reading.\n\n\n## Starting with the Client Brief\n\nIf you are lucky like me, you\u2019ll have a client who will supply you with an initial brief.\n\nThese usually include\u2026\n\n- the main objective of the email\n- the target audience\n- an early draft of the content\n- guidance on potential photography\n- ideas about potential design style\n\n(Hopefully it goes without saying that writing the content and defining a marketing strategy for an email is a whole other task that won\u2019t be covered in this article).\n\n### The Content\n\nThis is an example of the kind of content that a typical email might include\u2026\n\n- Logo\n- Main image\n- Heading 1\n- Paragraph (or two) of body copy\n- A main call to action (CTA) button\n- Contact details\n- Social media icons\n- Small print\n- Unsubscribe link\n- View in a browser link\n\n\n## What Email Clients Are Your Users Using?\n\nIt\u2019s worth trying to find out as much information as you can about the recipients early on, as this will effect the design as well as the build.\n\nIf your audience are using modern email clients you might want to try some cutting edge techniques like [moving images](http:\/\/createsend.com\/t\/y-92882CC1798554A3) or [web fonts](http:\/\/www.emaildesignreview.com\/html-email-coding\/web-fonts-in-email-1482\/).\n\nThe bad news is, despite [community efforts](http:\/\/www.email-standards.org\/) the state of email standards is a lot worse than the state of web standards. And many very popular email clients (like Gmail) are reluctant to get on board with a consistent approach.\n\nThe reality is you will probably need to support a range of web, mobile and desktop clients, including the notorious Outlook (which incase you don\u2019t know, is like the Internet Explorer of email clients).\n\nOnce you know what email clients you need to support, this guide from Campaign Monitor is really useful for checking what CSS is supported by various email clients: [The Ultimate Guide to CSS](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/css\/).\n\n![CSS Support in Emails](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-css-support-table.png)\n\nIf you can\u2019t get any information about what email clients your users have, then this website from Litmus lists the top 10 clients according to their analytics: [Email Client Market Share](http:\/\/emailclientmarketshare.com\/). You\u2019ll notice that \u2018mobile\u2019 makes up a big chunk of users.\n\n![Email Client Market Share](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-client-market-share.png)\n\n\n## Sketching\n\nOnce I\u2019ve got the brief, I like to scribble all the elements I need on a piece of paper. First I\u2019ll just list them, marking them up as h1, paragraph, call to action, small print etc.\n\nThis helps me to develop a hierarchy and a source order. And, by initially limiting myself to a single column, it forces me to think in a mobile-first kind of way.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll begin to sketch a layout, slowly grouping the elements together into a very rough design.\n\n![Sketching an Email Design](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-design-sketch.png)\n\n\n## Designing\n\nIf this is the first ever campaign, or the design is a big departure from previous campaigns, then I\u2019ll jump into Photoshop (or whatever) at this point to mock-up a concept. This is useful for me as it helps to experiment with and gather any fonts, colours and imagery etc that I\u2019ll be using.\n\n![Designing an Email in Illustrator](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/designing-an-email.jpg)\n\nIf you are comfortable working directly in the browser than do that, I think that whatever is the fastest and most comfortable way for you to begin iterating on the design is the best route to take.\n\n### How Big Should an Email Be?\n\nAlthough it\u2019s becoming less clear cut with responsive design, I still like to design my emails at [around 600px wide](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/post\/2094\/maximum-width-for-html-emails\/).\n\nBecause I\u2019ve already sketched out my source order, I have a good idea how things will look on mobile too, so I don\u2019t spend any time mocking things up at different widths.\n\nIn terms of email height (and file weight) I think the smaller the better is a good rule of thumb. Your content should be [focused and concise](http:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/email-design-guide\/) and this in-turn should result in a small email.\n\n### Keep Things Simple\n\nMy advice would be to keep things simple, just because we might be working with a 12 column grid, doesn\u2019t mean we should use every one.\n\nComplicated designs take a very long time to test once built. And *more importantly*, at 600px wide, any more than 2 or 3 columns of text is unlikely to give a comfortable read and is going to start to feel very cramped.\n\n### The Inbox\n\nDon\u2019t forget how cluttered\u00a0many email clients can be, don\u2019t let your complicated design contribute to the noise. Your users probably don\u2019t want to waste time and effort reading your email. So my recommendation would be to design with 1 column and plenty of space between elements to make things as easy as possible.\n\n![A Busy Email Inbox](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/busy-email-inbox-interface.jpg)\n\nConsider also how the email copy will read in the inbox\u00a0view too. The user may be presented with just\u00a0the name of the sender, the subject line, and just a few words from the beginning of the email, before they decide whether to read it, swipe it straight to archive, or even worse, mark it as spam.\n\n![The iPhone\u2019s Mail Inbox Preview Pane](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-preview-pane.png)\n\n### Spam\n\nOn the note of spam, I\u2019d urge you take it seriously and please don\u2019t bombard people. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the rules and regulations this is a good starting point: [Spam Lawsuits (by MailChimp)](http:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/guides\/spam-lawsuits\/html\/).\n\n\n## Build\n\n### Choosing a Framework\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a huge fan of using frameworks to build websites, but when it comes to emails, there are so many hacks and gotchas that trying to build something from scratch, even if you are familiar with HTML and CSS will probably send you crazy.\n\nAs I\u2019m sure most of you know, HTML emails are built with tables instead of divs for layout. And for fine-grained control over things like spacing, you may even need to put each heading and paragraph in their own table cells too.\n\n![Bloated Email Code](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-bloated-code.jpg)\n\nThis results in horribly bloated code. And that\u2019s before you\u2019ve added all the CSS inline (we need to do this because Outlook and Gmail strip out CSS from the head).\n\n### Ink\n\nThe framework I currently use is called [Ink](http:\/\/zurb.com\/ink\/), which was created by Zurb, the people behind the [Foundation](http:\/\/foundation.zurb.com\/) framework.\n\nInk has a 12 column grid, that drops to a single column below 600px. They have an [inliner](http:\/\/zurb.com\/ink\/inliner.php) on their website which lets you build your email in a more traditional way (i.e. keeping the HTML and CSS separate). Then the inliner can be used to process your code, and inject the relevant CSS around each element.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve learnt how to use Ink\u2019s grids, buttons and panels etc, then the actual build is fairly straightforward. If you get stuck then they have some [great documentation available](http:\/\/zurb.com\/ink\/docs.php).\n\n### Other Tools, Frameworks and Approaches\n\n- [Responsive Email Patterns](http:\/\/responsiveemailpatterns.com\/)\n- [Hybrid Coding](http:\/\/labs.actionrocket.co\/the-hybrid-coding-approach)\n- [Antwort Responsive Layouts for Email](http:\/\/internations.github.io\/antwort\/)\n- [Transactional HTML Email Templates](http:\/\/blog.mailgun.com\/transactional-html-email-templates\/)\n- [Email Design Guidelines](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/will-it-work\/guidelines\/)\n- [Canvas](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/canvas\/)\n- [Bulletproof email buttons](http:\/\/buttons.cm\/)\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting is the most difficult and tedious part about building an email. Even when using the Ink framework, I find that three quarters of my entire time on a project is spent debugging layout issues. Luckily there are lots of tools and resources out there to help.\n\nOnce my email has been designed, built and processed with Ink\u2019s inliner (to bring the CSS inline), I\u2019m nearly ready to begin testing.\n\n### Before Testing, Don\u2019t Forget to\u2026\n\n- Proof read of the copy\n- Double check phone numbers and email addresses (in the markup too)\n- Check you\u2019ve included alt text and titles attributes where appropriate\n- Remove any unused CSS (frameworks are notorious for adding bloat)\n- [Optimize images](https:\/\/imageoptim.com\/)\n- [Check your email with images turned-off](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/will-it-work\/image-blocking\/)\n- Update images to have absolute paths\n\nI usually stick the images in my Dropbox public folder while testing. Many ESPs (Email Service Providers) will have the ability to host your images too.\n\nNote: I\u2019ve noticed that certain imageproxys (like Outlook.com\u2019s) will refuse to load images from certain sources. I don\u2019t pretend to understand why this happens, but if it does, try hosting your images somewhere else.\n\n### Using MailChimp to Send Test Campaigns\n\nThis is where MailChimp comes in for me, you can sign up for a free account and use it to send tests to a few personal accounts.\n\n### Currently, I Test on the Following Email Clients\u2026\n\n- Gmail.com (Chrome, Firefox & Internet Explorer)\n- Outlook.com\u00a0(Chrome, Firefox & Internet Explorer)\n- Yahoo.com\u00a0(Chrome, Firefox & Internet Explorer)\n- AOL.com (Chrome, Firefox & Internet Explorer)\n- iPhone 5c\n- iPad\n- Mail (OSX)\n- Thunderbird (OSX)\n- Outlook (Windows)\n- Windows Live Mail (Windows)\n\nThe last email I did took about 15 tests before I was happy with it. Testing the same design 15 times on multiple email clients can get pretty demoralising, so to help ease the pain I created this handy [PDF for testing email clients](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-client-testing.pdf \"Email Testing PDF\").\n\n### Debugging Common Problems\n\nIn my experience, inspecting the code is rarely useful (and not always even possible). So the best route when you find a problem is to search the web.\n\nHere are a few common ones\u2026\n\n- [Use CSS Attribute Selectors to stop Yahoo rendering your media query styles](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/post\/3457\/media-query-issues-in-yahoo-mail-mobile-email\/)\n- [Use `!important` in your mobile media queries, to make sure the styles override the inline desktop styles](https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/guides\/mobile\/coding\/)\n- [Use `<span>` to style blue links on iOS](https:\/\/litmus.com\/blog\/update-banning-blue-links-on-ios-devices)\n- [Use `<td>` and padding to get reliable spacing around chunks of text](https:\/\/litmus.com\/blog\/hotmail-and-outlook-com-drop-support-for-margin)\n- [Use `vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\u201d` to get padding around images in Outlook](http:\/\/www.sparkemaildesign.com\/17-must-know-tricks-for-outlook-2007-2010-and-2013\/#outlook07-13_tip1)\n\nThe [Litmus](https:\/\/litmus.com\/blog\/) and [Email on Acid](https:\/\/www.emailonacid.com\/blog) blogs are usually the best place to find solutions to problems.\n\n### Virtual Testing with Litmus (via MailChimp)\n\nOnce I\u2019m happy with the design in the email clients that I have direct access to (it doesn\u2019t need to be pixel perfect), I will run some virtual tests for good measure. These services allow you test in a whole raft of Email Clients (40+) which is pretty difficult to achieve without access to a comprehensive Device Lab.\n\nThere are two email testing services that I would recommend\u2026\n\n1. [Litmus](https:\/\/litmus.com\/)\n2. [Email on Acid](http:\/\/www.emailonacid.com\/)\n\nRather than use these services directly, I use a feature via MailChimp called Inbox Inspection. This is powered by Litmus, and if you have a free MailChimp account, it only costs $3 per test which can work out cheaper than a monthly subscription.\n\n![Email Design Testing with Litmus](http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-design-testing.png)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope you found this write-up of my email design process useful. It\u2019s worth reiterating that you should keep the design as simple as possible and leave plenty of time for testing.

This is powered by Litmus, and if you have a free MailChimp account, it only costs $3 per test which can work out cheaper than a monthly subscription.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-924\" src=\"http:\/\/www.benjystanton.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/email-design-testing.png\" alt=\"Email Design Testing with Litmus\" width=\"700\" height=\"386\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I hope you found this write-up of my email design process useful. It\u2019s worth reiterating that you should keep the design as simple as possible and leave plenty of time for testing.

Tweet about it, share it on Facebook, tell your Nan. You never know where work will come from\u2026 and in my experience, people like to help you out when you are just starting.\n\n### Love thy client\n\nI try to work really hard for my clients. Not only do I want to do a good job for them. But I want them to recommend me to other potential clients. Given that it can be hard to get new clients\u2026 hang on to the good ones that you have. Find ways to show them that you care about their business.\n\n### Go out and find work\n\n- Tweet that you are looking for work\n- Ask local agencies if you can pop in for a coffee (don\u2019t give them the hard sell)\n- [Working Nomads](http:\/\/www.workingnomads.co \"A curated list of remote jobs\")\n- [Need](https:\/\/needhq.com\/ \"Apply as a freelancer to receive job notifications\")\n\n\n## Money, business, tax etc.\n\n### Being self employed\n\nRegistering as self employed is very easy and you can do it via The HMRC website. One day, I intend to go VAT registered and become a Limited Company, but for now self employment suits me fine.\n\n### Hang on to paperwork\n\nIf you have just left your job, hang on to your pay slips and P45. In fact, just keep every bit of paper from now on.\n\n### Saving for your tax bill\n\nEvery month, I aim to \u2018pay myself\u2019 a regular amount of money. In reality this means transferring money from my business account into my personal account. I then keep a portion of this aside in a savings account, ready for my tax bill.\n\n### Banking\n\nHaving a separate bank account is a really good idea. I found that using Lloyds (because I do my personal banking with them) was the quickest and easiest was to setup a business account.\n\nMost business accounts tend to have a \u2018free banking\u2019 period (around 12 months) where they won\u2019t charge you for transactions.\n\n### Use FreeAgent\n\nFreeAgent is a simple accounting tool that helps you to track your time, send invoices, log expenses and fill out your tax return. I can\u2019t recommend it enough.\n\nSign up with [my FreeAgent referral link](http:\/\/fre.ag\/43iztqfq) and we\u2019ll both get 10% off.\n\n### What to charge\n\nI used the handy [UK Freelance Rates Calculator](http:\/\/ournameismud.co.uk\/fraq\/) by [Cole Henley](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cole007 \"Cole on Twitter\").\n\n### Get business insurance\n\nHaving business insurance helps me to sleep at night. I used [Insurance by Jack](http:\/\/insurancebyjack.co.uk\/) to sort my policy.\n\n### Expenses\n\nRecord all your expenses. In most cases, I receive invoices via email (for Adobe Creative Cloud, FreeAgent, hosting etc.) which are easy to save for later. If you are buying things when out and about, make sure you keep the receipt (you can claim expenses on things you pay for using cash and personal cards too). Keep a note of mileage, travel costs and house bills too.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope this helps with some of the questions that you may have about going freelance.

One day, I intend to go VAT registered and become a Limited Company, but for now self employment suits me fine.<\/p>\n<h3>Hang on to paperwork<\/h3>\n<p>If you have just left your job, hang on to your pay slips and P45. In fact, just keep every bit of paper from now on.<\/p>\n<h3>Saving for your tax bill<\/h3>\n<p>Every month, I aim to \u2018pay myself\u2019 a regular amount of money. In reality this means transferring money from my business account into my personal account. I then keep a portion of this aside in a savings account, ready for my tax bill.<\/p>\n<h3>Banking<\/h3>\n<p>Having a separate bank account is a really good idea. I found that using Lloyds (because I do my personal banking with them) was the quickest and easiest was to setup a business account.<\/p>\n<p>Most business accounts tend to have a \u2018free banking\u2019 period (around 12 months) where they won\u2019t charge you for transactions.<\/p>\n<h3>Use FreeAgent<\/h3>\n<p>FreeAgent is a simple accounting tool that helps you to track your time, send invoices, log expenses and fill out your tax return. I can\u2019t recommend it enough.<\/p>\n<p>Sign up with <a href=\"http:\/\/fre.ag\/43iztqfq\">my FreeAgent referral link<\/a> and we\u2019ll both get 10% off.<\/p>\n<h3>What to charge<\/h3>\n<p>I used the handy <a href=\"http:\/\/ournameismud.co.uk\/fraq\/\">UK Freelance Rates Calculator<\/a> by <a title=\"Cole on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cole007\">Cole Henley<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Get business insurance<\/h3>\n<p>Having business insurance helps me to sleep at night. I used <a href=\"http:\/\/insurancebyjack.co.uk\/\">Insurance by Jack<\/a> to sort my policy.<\/p>\n<h3>Expenses<\/h3>\n<p>Record all your expenses. In most cases, I receive invoices via email (for Adobe Creative Cloud, FreeAgent, hosting etc.) which are easy to save for later. If you are buying things when out and about, make sure you keep the receipt (you can claim expenses on things you pay for using cash and personal cards too). Keep a note of mileage, travel costs and house bills too.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I hope this helps with some of the questions that you may have about going freelance.
